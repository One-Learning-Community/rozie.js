# @rozie-ui/rete-angular

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- f3266db: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken`
  alongside the existing `RozieSlot` marker directive. The Angular target used to
  inline a copy of these three helpers (and, for `rozieToken`, its
  `globalThis`-backed cross-package registry) as module-scope declarations in
  _every_ emitted component that wrapped an interpolation or used the
  `$provide`/`$inject` context primitive — duplicating the same ~40 lines across 21
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaves. The emitter now imports the helpers from
  `@rozie/runtime-angular` instead.

  Behavior is unchanged: the delegating `rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr` class methods
  Angular templates call are untouched, `rozieToken`'s `globalThis`-backed identity
  guarantee is preserved verbatim, and a component using none of the three continues
  to carry no reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` at all. `number-field` and `otp`
  (previously the only two Angular leaves with no existing `@rozie/runtime-angular`
  dependency) now declare it in both `package.json` and `ng-package.json`'s
  `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/rete` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0`/`0.1.1` numbers were never published; they are changesets ripples from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps. Carries `tslib` only, no `@rozie` runtime dependency.

  **The FlowCanvas family** — a controlled node-graph canvas over the `rete` engine:
  - `<FlowCanvas>` — 21 props, 12 events and a 27-verb imperative handle, with `graph`, `zoom` and `mode` as two-way models. Built-in Controls and MiniMap, labeled + styled edges, undo/redo, auto-arrange (elkjs), marquee select, a node toolbar slot, and the `background` pattern variants (`dots` / `lines` / `cross` / `none`).
  - `<NodeType>` — render-by-type node bodies through a reactive `body` portal slot, with per-type `resizable` plus min/max width and height.
  - `<Port>` — the typed directional port schema (`output` / `input`, `type`, `label`, `multiple`, `position`), declared against the enclosing `<NodeType>`.
  - Four `themes/*.css` token presets ship in the tarball (`base`, `shadcn`, `material`, `bootstrap`).
