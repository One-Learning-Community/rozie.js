# @rozie-ui/combobox-react

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f1fd891: Combobox gains multi-select, a floating-positioned popup, and creatable mode; popover gains two opt-in composition primitives; command-palette's combobox peer moves to admit the new minor.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — multi-select via a widened model, not a second one.** A new `multiple: Boolean` prop (default `false`) turns the existing sole `value` model into an array of selected values — there is still only one `model: true` prop, so `[formControl]` / `[(ngModel)]` binding on Angular is unaffected. Re-selecting a selected option toggles it off; selected values render as chips in selection order through a new `#chip` scoped slot (`{ option, remove, index }`); duplicate values dedupe to one chip; a chip whose option later disappears from `options` persists, labelled by its raw value; Backspace on an empty query removes the last chip. `aria-multiselectable="true"` and per-option `aria-selected` are present on the listbox when `multiple` is on. Works across all four render branches (plain, `groups`, `groups`+`groupCap`, `virtual`).

  The `change` event payload gains a `selected` field — the direction of the toggle (`true` when a value was added, `false` when removed or after `clear()`). This is purely additive for existing single-select consumers destructuring `{ value, option }`: `selected` is simply a new property, always `true` for a single-select pick.

  **Consumer-visible DOM change under `multiple`:** selected chips render as a `<ul class="rozie-combobox-chips">` inside the composed popover's anchor content, immediately before the `<input>`, guarded solely on `multiple` — so the chip rail plus the input together become what the floating popup's `matchWidth` measures. Consumer CSS that targets `.rozie-combobox`'s direct children may need attention when opting into `multiple`; the non-`multiple` DOM shape is unchanged.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — floating-positioned popup, composed rather than reimplemented.** The popup is now positioned by Floating UI through the published `@rozie-ui/popover` leaf (a new `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` peer on all six leaves) rather than static CSS: it flips and shifts to stay on screen near a viewport edge. `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, and `disableShift` forward to the composed popover. Under `inline`, a Popover is still mounted — what `inline` switches off is positioning and dismissal, via `disablePositioning` and `disableDismiss`; the list continues to render through the same composed popover as the floating mode.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — creatable mode.** A new `creatable: Boolean` prop (default `false`). When committed text matches no existing option (case-insensitive, trimmed, exact label match), combobox emits a new `create` event with the query string and writes nothing to `value` — the consumer owns adding the option and updating the model. The create affordance renders last, through a new `#create` scoped slot, after all options and group sections. Composes with `multiple`.

  **`@rozie-ui/popover` — five new opt-in, gated capabilities, shipping as a MINOR.** All six leaves land on `0.2.0` in this wave. `bare: Boolean` strips Popover's own positioning wrapper output down to a minimal unstyled surface — for a composing component (like combobox's floating mode) that wants Popover's mount/dismiss lifecycle without its default chrome. `disablePositioning: Boolean` takes the panel out of Floating UI's positioning path entirely, so it participates in ordinary document flow instead of being absolutely positioned — this is what `inline` mode now relies on, and it previously had no release note at all. `keepMounted: Boolean` hides the floating panel instead of unmounting it (a one-shot position on mount, `autoUpdate` still strictly open-gated) — useful for a composed virtualizer whose scroll container must survive close/open. `matchWidth: Boolean` matches the panel's width exactly to its anchor via Floating UI's `size` middleware, width-only. `disableDismiss: Boolean` suppresses Popover's own Escape-key and click-outside dismissal listeners — for a composing component that drives `open` itself and needs to veto Popover's independent dismissal while a host sub-surface anchored to (but not nested inside) the composed control legitimately holds focus. All five default to `false`; existing click/hover/focus, non-`bare`, non-`disablePositioning`, non-`keepMounted`, non-`matchWidth`, non-`disableDismiss` consumers see no behavioral or visual change to the pre-wave 12-prop surface — verified via an additive-only `.d.ts` diff and Docker VR runs with zero unexplained baseline diffs. Three CSS rules were ADDED to support these capabilities (`--static`, `--bare`, `--hidden`); the pre-existing rule set is itself unchanged, but a reader should not infer that no rules were added at all.

  Two caveats existing consumers should know before adopting either capability: **`matchWidth` is not reversible** — there is no `$watch` and no code path that ever clears the inline `style.width` the `size` middleware writes once applied, so a consumer that toggles `matchWidth` off at runtime will see the stale width persist. And **existing `trigger="manual"` consumers DO see an emitted-DOM change**: `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` were unconditional pre-wave and are now gated on a new `hasGestureTrigger()` check (`trigger === 'click' || 'hover' || 'focus'`), so a `trigger="manual"` popover no longer emits those two attributes.

  **`@rozie-ui/command-palette` — combobox peer range widens; the FILES and the COMPONENT tell two different stories.** All six leaves widen their `@rozie-ui/combobox-<target>` peer from `^0.4.0` to `^0.5.0`. A caret range on a 0.x version pins the minor, so the previous range does not admit combobox's incoming `0.5.0` — every leaf moves in this same wave or the published command-palette leaves become uninstallable against the combobox version they actually need.

  **File-truth:** zero source drift. The complete diff across all six `@rozie-ui/command-palette-<target>` leaves is six `package.json` peer lines, independently confirmed by a published-tarball audit showing all six leaves drifting on `package.json:manifest` only.

  **Component-truth:** the rendered component is not unchanged, because it composes combobox and inherits combobox's own popover composition. It now unconditionally mounts a Popover, adding `.rozie-popover-anchor` / `.rozie-popover-floating` wrapper elements to the DOM; it gains an unconditional `queueMicrotask` focus re-assertion routed through combobox's `onFocus` on all six targets; and `pinned` moves from a module-scope `let` to reactive `$data`. `command-palette` itself still uses `inline` (never floats). The command-palette audit traced all three of these and found no defect follows from any of them — noted here so a reader relying on "peer range only" does not miss real, if inert, DOM and behavior changes.

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-react@0.7.1

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 6274a5f: React's `useMemo` stabilization of an escaping top-level `const` was discovered by a
  ONE-LEVEL, NON-TRANSITIVE scan of `Listener.deps` / `LifecycleHook.setupDeps` — a
  `new X()` an effect reached only THROUGH a top-level helper (`buildState() ->
gutterCompartment.of(...)`) was invisible to that scan and never got `useMemo`, so React
  rebuilt it fresh every render. For an identity-keyed engine object (a CodeMirror6
  `Compartment`, a Map/WeakMap/Set used as cross-render scratch state) this silently no-ops
  any imperative API keyed on that instance's identity — CodeMirror's
  `scheduleReconfigure(compartment, ...)` against an `EditorState` that never saw the fresh
  Compartment being the corpus shape that surfaced this. All four turbo gates (build, test,
  dist-parity, typecheck) stayed green while the bug was live; only visual regression testing
  caught it.

  `computeEscapingNames` (`packages/targets/react/src/emit/computeEscapingNames.ts`) now runs
  a worklist-to-fixpoint over top-level helper bodies: a helper name reached by an
  effect/listener seed is walked (its body inspected for further references) but never itself
  promoted into the escaping set — only a non-function top-level `const` binder reached at any
  depth through that walk is added. This bound is deliberate: promoting a helper NAME into the
  escaping set would flip a hoisted `function` declaration back into a non-hoisted
  `useCallback` const, reopening the temporal-dead-zone class the emitter's plain-hoist branch
  exists to close, across 860+ shipped `function` declarations corpus-wide. The duplicated seed
  computation (previously maintained independently in two places in `emitScript.ts`) is now
  one shared computation, so the `useMemo`/`useCallback` wrap decision and the seam-3 staleness
  classification can never silently diverge.

  The CodeMirror unwind quick 260829-gbs had to revert (`5d48f9156`, because the two
  `code-mirror [react]` VR cells failed all retries under the pre-fix emitter) is re-landed:
  all six leaves regenerated from the fixed emitter, all ten CM6 `Compartment` instances now
  emit as `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` on React, and the five non-React leaves are
  byte-identical to the original unwind (`61bf99340`) — the emitter fix itself is React-only.

  Four other shipped React leaves carried a const of this exact shape and changed wrap form as
  an expected consequence, each individually inspected (correct empty dep array on a
  non-reactive initializer, no reactive-read case regressed to `[]`, no `.current`-read freeze
  hazard, and zero helper `function` declarations flipped form anywhere in the corpus):
  `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` (`GRID_PAGE_STEP`, `DATA_WRITE_TOKEN_KEY`, `SELECT_COL_ID`,
  `EXPANDER_COL_ID`), `@rozie-ui/rete-react` (`RESIZE_MIN_FALLBACK`, `CONN_WARN_SETTLE_MS`,
  `HISTORY_CAP`, `ZOOM_STEP`), and `@rozie-ui/toast-react` (`EXIT_FAILSAFE_MS`). Every one is a
  bare literal initializer reading nothing, so `[]` is the correct and complete dep array.

  **Emitted-comment fidelity — two structural fixes.** The component-scope emission loop mixes
  statements emitted as hand-built STRINGS (four `tryWrap*` passes) with statements emitted
  through a per-statement `@babel/generator` call, each of the latter carrying its own
  printed-comment dedup set. Because Babel attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements to
  BOTH neighbours at once, a shared comment printed TWICE (both neighbours rendered it) or ZERO
  times (neither did), depending purely on which pass claimed each side — and both failures
  were live in the shipped corpus simultaneously. No per-wrap rule can be right for both sides,
  so the decision moved to a block-wide printed-comment ledger keyed on comment object
  identity, which prints every comment exactly once in source order regardless of which pass
  claims either neighbour. This mirrors the single-dedup-set precedent `genBlockInner` and
  `genImportsBlock` already set for their own scopes.

  Separately, `hoistModuleLet` removed a hoisted `let`'s declaration from the component body
  and took the author's comment on that declaration with it. Those leading comments are now
  re-homed onto the nearest surviving neighbour before removal. This one was invisible from
  inside a single component: an inline host kept such a comment (its neighbour is one parse
  away and carries it as `trailingComments`) while the byte-identical `<script src>`
  partial-inlined host — whose spliced node comes from a DIFFERENT parse with no comments
  attached — lost it. `dist-parity`'s Phase 56-R8 / R11 partial-vs-inline byte-identity cells
  are what caught it.

  Net effect across the shipped React corpus: 2110 comment lines restored, 187 duplicate
  prints removed, and **zero** comments dropped and **zero** non-comment bytes changed —
  verified line-by-line against the pre-change corpus. Fifteen further React leaves are bumped
  here for that comment-fidelity restoration alone, with no code change:
  `@rozie-ui/captcha-react`, `chartjs-react`, `combobox-react`, `command-palette-react`,
  `cropper-react`, `date-picker-react`, `embla-react`, `flatpickr-react`, `otp-react`,
  `pdf-react`, `popover-react`, `sortable-list-react`, `tags-react`, `tiptap-react`, and
  `wavesurfer-react`.

  Nine more React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately OMITTED from
  the front matter: `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package alongside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail
  outright — the exact breakage `8865e96df` repaired, not reintroduced here.

- 4a2de54: React dropped the author's leading comments on any top-level `const f = () => {…}`. The
  emitter rebuilds those as `function f() {…}` so the binding hoists (a real TDZ fix), but it
  returned the bare synthetic node — no source position and no comments attached — so
  `@babel/generator` printed the declaration and silently discarded everything documenting it.
  Measured against the shipped corpus, that was 683 of React's 899 lost comments; Solid, whose
  identically-named `tryHoistArrowToFunction` has always ended with `t.inherits(fn, stmt)`,
  lost none. React simply never got that line.

  Restoring it alone is only half the mechanism, and the half on its own is a regression. A
  comment authored between a hoisted module-`let` and the declaration below it survives on the
  inline path (one parse attaches the comment object to both neighbours, so the successor still
  carries it) but not across a `<script src>` partial boundary, where the spliced successor
  comes from a different parse with nothing attached. There the comment lives only on the
  removed `let`'s trailing side and dies with the statement — so the inline host printed a
  comment the partial-inlined host could not, and the two stopped being byte-identical.

  Quick task 260829-j18 re-homed a removed statement's LEADING comments onto a surviving
  neighbour but deliberately skipped the trailing side, on the reasoning that a removed
  statement's trailing comments are the same objects Babel attached as the next statement's
  leading comments, so that side already had an owner. That holds for an inline-authored
  `<script>` and fails at a splice boundary. `hoistModuleLet` now re-homes the trailing side
  too, onto the nearest following survivor, deduped by comment object IDENTITY — which is what
  keeps the inline case from double-printing, since there the object is already present on the
  successor.

  The two changes ship together and are asserted together: `dist-parity`'s multi-boundary
  "DataTable-shaped permanent guard" goes red with either half missing, and green with both.

  Across the 38 regenerated React leaves this restores **2655 comments, with zero comments
  dropped and zero non-comment bytes changed** — verified by parsing each file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides, rather than by reading the diff. The
  dist-parity fixture rebless was verified the same way (55 comments restored, no code delta).

  One cosmetic wart, not fixed here: in `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` a single restored comment
  prints on the same line as the preceding function's closing brace (`} // …`) instead of
  starting its own line, because it is re-homed as the previous statement's trailing comment.
  The block still reads immediately above the declaration it documents and the AST is
  unaffected. Output prettiness stays a v2 concern.

  Nine further React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately absent from
  the front matter — `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package beside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.
  - @rozie/runtime-react@0.7.0

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-react@0.6.0

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Stale-publish reconciliation: republish so the tarball matches the committed generated source. The sole drift was a documentation-comment correction in the generated component source (removal of a stale "byte-identical to today" claim from the groupCap prose) that landed without a version bump. No behavioral change.
  - @rozie/runtime-react@0.5.2

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Mount-time staleness fix. Values read inside `$onMount` are now mirrored through synced refs, so a callback registered once at mount no longer reads the first render's values for the lifetime of the component. A consumer that changes a prop — or passes a new handler identity — after mount is now observed by the mount-registered callback instead of being silently ignored.

  Only the **helper-call** read kind landed here — `buildVirtualizer()`, `syncQueryToValue()` and `syncRows()` are now invoked through synced refs, so the mount-registered wiring operates on the current rows/query state rather than the state captured at mount. No prop read or `$emit` handler in this component was affected.

- The mount effect's dependency array is now honest, so the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppression is no longer emitted.
- No API surface change.
- @rozie/runtime-react@0.2.3

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. Declared emit handlers were also landing in the root DOM fallthrough spread and firing twice per emit — the emitter now keeps them out of it. No API surface change.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-react@0.2.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- afa0a7e: The `virtual` prop is now **live-flippable at runtime**. Previously the TanStack windowing engine was constructed exactly once in `$onMount`, so a runtime `false→true` flip rendered a blank popup and a `true→false` flip left a live `ResizeObserver` (and stale windowing state) behind.

  `buildVirtualizer()`/`teardownVirtualizer()` now share the single construction site `$onMount` also calls, wired to a new lazy watch on `virtual`: flipping to `true` (re)builds the windowing engine (rAF-deferred so the windowed popup has mounted its scroll container first) and resets any expanded-group state; flipping to `false` tears it down immediately, disconnecting the `ResizeObserver` — fixing the leak. During the brief mid-flip frame (virtual on, engine not yet attached) the popup renders the un-windowed full option list rather than going blank.

  No prop/model/emit/slot/expose surface change — `virtual` already existed. A `virtual:false` combobox that never flips it, and a `virtual:true`-at-mount combobox that never flips it back, both render byte-identically to before.

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-react@0.2.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 564ed59: Per-group result cap with an expand-in-place "+N more" affordance — new
  `groupCap` prop + `#groupMore` slot.

  Set `groupCap` alongside `groups` to cap each native section to its first
  `groupCap` options; an overflowing section renders a keyboard-reachable
  "+N more" row after its capped options. Activating the row (Enter while it
  is the active-descendant, or a click) expands **that section only**, in
  place — the remaining options render inline and the row disappears. It never
  writes the `value` model or fires `change`; expansion is purely a reveal.
  `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` rove onto the more-row like any option and, once
  expanded, continue into the newly-revealed options — `aria-activedescendant`
  always resolves to a rendered row. Expansion state resets whenever the
  option set or the typed query changes.

  New slot `groupMore` (scope `{ group, hidden, expand }`) customizes the
  more-row's markup; the default fill renders `+{hidden} more`.

  `0`/absent (default) is uncapped and byte-identical to plain grouping.
  `groupCap` only applies to the standard (non-`virtual`) grouped render, same
  as `groups` itself.

- 99fee43: Added a `pinOpen(boolean)` imperative handle verb. While pinned, blurring the
  input (e.g. because a host sub-surface like an action flyout took real DOM
  focus) no longer collapses the result popup — `onBlur()` early-returns while
  pinned. `pinOpen(false)` only unpins; it does not itself close the popup or
  restore focus, which stays the host's responsibility.

  Additive and render-neutral: never calling `pinOpen` leaves behavior
  byte-identical to before this release.

### Patch Changes

- d3782ef: Three additive, render-neutral tokens (every fallback replicates today's
  rendered value, so a consumer who never sets these sees no change):
  - `--rozie-combobox-focus-border-color` — the input's `:focus` border color,
    decoupled from `--rozie-combobox-accent` (which also colors the selected
    option), so a host can neutralize the focus border independently.
  - `--rozie-combobox-input-underline` — a bottom-border longhand that
    survives the `:focus` `border-color` override, letting a host render a
    persistent bottom divider (blurred and focused) without a full border.
  - `--rozie-combobox-group-heading-margin-top` — top margin above each group
    heading, for separating the leading ungrouped block from the first
    labeled section.

  Landed alongside `@rozie-ui/command-palette`'s style polish, which drives
  these tokens from its panel scope for a clean, borderless, ring-free input.

- f3e1bdf: fix: keep the active option scrolled into view during keyboard navigation in non-virtual lists

  Arrow-key navigation in a plain (non-`virtual`) popup previously moved
  `activeIndex`/`aria-activedescendant` but never scrolled the option list
  container, so the active option could walk out of view in a long list
  taller than the popup's max-height (visible in `@rozie-ui/command-palette`'s
  longer command lists). `scrollActiveIntoView()` now also resolves the active
  option element and calls `scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })` on it when
  not windowing. The `virtual` (windowed) path is unchanged — it still routes
  through the virtualizer's `scrollToIndex`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 55b41c5: Add first-class, opt-in option grouping to `Combobox`.

  **Native option grouping:** options gain an optional `group?: string` field,
  and a new ordered `groups` prop (`[{ id, label }]`) sets section order +
  heading text. When grouping is active, the popup listbox restructures into
  semantic `role="group"` blocks with `aria-label` headings — a new
  `#groupHeading` slot (scope `{ group }`) lets you customize heading
  rendering; the default renders `group.label`. A group id present on an
  option but absent from `groups` falls back to a section titled with the id
  itself, appended after the listed ones (first-appearance order); options
  with no `group` render in a single leading, unheaded section.

  Grouping is a **stable re-partition** of the filtered option list — within
  every section, options keep their filtered/scored order (never re-sorted).
  The keyboard model (`ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown`/`Home`/`End`/`Enter`,
  `aria-activedescendant`) is unchanged: it walks the same group-ordered flat
  sequence, so on-screen order always matches keyboard order, and headings are
  never a keyboard stop.

  **Leaving `groups` empty (and no option carrying `group`) is byte-identical
  to today's flat, ungrouped combobox** — grouping is strictly additive and
  opt-in; no behavior changes for existing consumers, including
  `@rozie-ui/command-palette` and `@rozie-ui/data-table`, which vendor this
  combobox but do not yet pass `groups`.

  Grouping is supported only in the standard (non-`virtual`) render;
  `groups` × `virtual` windowing is not yet supported. Per-group item caps
  ("+N more") and `@rozie-ui/command-palette` adoption of `groups` are planned
  follow-ons, not included here.

- 458db46: Add a `seedQuery(text)` imperative handle verb to `Combobox`.

  `seedQuery` sets the combobox's internal input text (and therefore the
  filtered option list, which reads the same state) without touching the
  `value` model or selection state, and without opening the popup or emitting
  `change`/`search`. It is deliberately **imperative-only** — combobox's sole
  `model: true` prop stays `value` (a second model would forfeit the Angular
  `ControlValueAccessor`, ROZ125).

  Obtain it through each framework's native ref mechanism, alongside the
  existing `focus` and `clear` verbs:

  ```js
  $refs.combobox.seedQuery("cherry pie");
  ```

  A small, additive prerequisite for `@rozie-ui/command-palette`'s planned
  levels/restore-on-pop feature (repopulating the input's text when a consumer
  navigates back to a prior level) — not itself a `@rozie-ui/command-palette`
  or `@rozie-ui/data-table` behavior change. **Fully additive and
  render-neutral:** with `seedQuery` never invoked, `Combobox`'s default render
  and every compiled leaf's emitted output are unchanged.
