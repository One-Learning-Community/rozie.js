### Patch Changes

- Debut release of `@rozie-ui/wavesurfer` — an idiomatic cross-framework audio waveform
  player wrapping wavesurfer.js v7, shipping identically for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular,
  Solid, and Lit. Core waveform rendering and full playback control, the two-way
  `currentTime` binding, the Timeline and Hover plugins, and the interactive Regions
  plugin with a two-way `regions` binding.

  A deep pre-release audit (`.planning/quick/260811-kt2-wavesurfer-debut-shore-up/
AUDIT.md`) found no public-surface change from this shore-up wave — no prop, emit,
  model, slot, or expose verb was added, renamed, or removed — so this debut ships as a
  PATCH, aligning all six leaves at one version. The wave closed the family's full
  coverage gap in a single pass: every prop, emit, model, and expose verb now has a
  behavioral runtime assertion executed on all six targets (previously the family's only
  runtime exercise was a single static pixel cell). It also added JetBrains web-types.json
  (Vue) and a Custom Elements Manifest (Lit) IDE sidecars, generated from the same lowered
  IR the READMEs use.
