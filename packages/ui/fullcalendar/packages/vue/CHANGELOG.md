### Patch Changes

- ba42bc2: On React, Angular, and Lit, the synthesized `$portals` closure now lives at COMPONENT scope
  (React: the hook section; Angular/Lit: a private class field) instead of being declared
  inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook body. Vue, Svelte, and Solid already did the right
  thing and are unaffected in shape (Vue/Svelte additionally now declare the closure BEFORE
  the user script, matching Solid, closing a secondary TDZ hazard for a top-level invocation).

  This closes a silent parity bug: a `<script>` top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`
  previously compiled on three targets and failed on the other three — `TS2304 Cannot find
name 'portals'` on the bundled-leaf strict typecheck, `ReferenceError: portals is not
defined` at runtime, with zero diagnostics. Three failure shapes are fixed:
  1. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, called from `$onMount`.
  2. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, with NO `$onMount` at all — previously
     the whole closure was emitted NOWHERE on React (it was attached unconditionally to the
     first mount-phase hook; no hook meant it was silently dropped).
  3. A `$portals.<name>` read from a `$watch` body — broken on all three targets, and the
     shape driving most of the corpus workarounds this closes the door on.

  React additionally synthesizes a dispose-only effect (`[]` deps) for a component that has
  portals but no mount-phase lifecycle hook at all, so portal roots still bulk-dispose on
  unmount in that shape. Angular and Lit now lower `$portals.<name>` to a `this.`-qualified
  member read (the closure is a class field, not a same-method-only `const`); the
  reactive-handle `interface ReactivePortalHandle` moved to module scope on both (a TS
  `interface` cannot live inside a class body).

  A new diagnostic, ROZ149, now flags a `$portals.<name>` reference genuinely evaluated
  during setup/render — `<script>` Program top level, a `$computed` body, a `$watch` GETTER,
  or a template binding/directive/`r-for`-iterable/interpolation — since the portal anchor
  does not exist yet at those positions on any target, even after this fix. It does NOT fire
  on an ordinary function/arrow body (the shape this fix makes correct), `$onMount` /
  `$onUnmount` / `$onUpdate` bodies, a `$watch` CALLBACK, or event handlers.

  `.rozie` authors do not need to change anything for code that already calls `$portals` from
  inside `$onMount` — a hook-scope const / class field is visible from the method that used to
  declare it, so nothing that compiled before stops compiling. Emitted output is NOT
  byte-identical for any component with a portal slot — the closure text moves and, on
  Angular/Lit, gains a `this.` qualifier — so `@rozie-ui/chartjs`, `@rozie-ui/codemirror`,
  `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar`, `@rozie-ui/maplibre`, and `@rozie-ui/rete` (the shipped leaf
  packages whose `.rozie` sources declare a portal slot) take a patch bump alongside
  `@rozie/core`.

  The workaround bridges those five packages carry to route `$portals` calls into mount scope
  (null-let bridges, a "must not be called before mount" invariant, a relocated code block)
  are now unnecessary and can be unwound at leisure as an independent, opt-in follow-up — not
  part of this change.

  **Changeset scope note.** The six `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella packages are `private: true` and the repo sets `privatePackages.version: false`, so listing them alone versions nothing. The published, consumer-installed artifacts are the per-framework pre-compiled leaves (`@rozie-ui/<family>-<target>`), and they carry no dependency on `@rozie/core` — a core bump does not cascade to them. Since this change rewrites their emitted source, they are bumped explicitly. `@rozie-ui/maplibre-*` is omitted deliberately: those leaves are in the changeset config's `ignore` list. `-solid` leaves are omitted because Solid already emitted the closure at component scope and its output is unchanged.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated with the toolchain's Vue `$watch` flush:'post' fix: all `$watch`-driven prop/data reconcilers now run post-flush (after the DOM update, matching the React/Solid/Svelte/Angular/Lit leaves' timing) instead of Vue's default pre-flush. This closes the portal re-entrancy class (a portal fill mounting from inside an engine update can no longer synchronously flush a pending sibling watcher into the same engine mid-update) and the pre-flush `$refs`-read-too-early class (e.g. the embla runtime `thumbnails` toggle previously failed to build its thumb engine on Vue). No API surface change.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- A genuine patch roll since the published `0.1.1`, not a bookkeeping alignment: self-documenting prop descriptions from the codegen type-prop guard widening (`c3c748e7`) and the license/copyright header refresh (`a7733874`). No API change, no breaking change — the props/emits/slots/expose surface is unchanged, verified by the `tests/surface.test.ts` gate.
- This release also marks the debut of `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar` as a complete all-six-targets release line: `-react`/`-solid`/`-lit`/`-svelte`/`-angular` now publish alongside `-vue` for the first time, all aligned at `0.1.2`.
