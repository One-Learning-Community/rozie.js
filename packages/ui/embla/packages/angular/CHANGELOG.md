# @rozie-ui/embla-angular

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- f3266db: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken`
  alongside the existing `RozieSlot` marker directive. The Angular target used to
  inline a copy of these three helpers (and, for `rozieToken`, its
  `globalThis`-backed cross-package registry) as module-scope declarations in
  _every_ emitted component that wrapped an interpolation or used the
  `$provide`/`$inject` context primitive — duplicating the same ~40 lines across 21
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaves. The emitter now imports the helpers from
  `@rozie/runtime-angular` instead.

  Behavior is unchanged: the delegating `rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr` class methods
  Angular templates call are untouched, `rozieToken`'s `globalThis`-backed identity
  guarantee is preserved verbatim, and a component using none of the three continues
  to carry no reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` at all. `number-field` and `otp`
  (previously the only two Angular leaves with no existing `@rozie/runtime-angular`
  dependency) now declare it in both `package.json` and `ng-package.json`'s
  `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.

- 78d5b5b: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `createRozieAttrApplier` and
  `createRozieHostAttrsReader` alongside the existing `RozieSlot`,
  `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken` exports. The Angular target
  used to inline a copy of the `r-bind`/`$attrs` spread attribute applier and
  host-attribute reader (~85 lines: three `WeakMap` prev-state caches, the
  class/style merge logic, and the host-attribute fold) as a private-field
  IIFE pair in _every_ emitted component that used `r-bind` spread or read
  `$attrs` — 158 tracked emitted files, of which 23 are shipped
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaf sources across 21 leaves.

  The emitted component keeps performing both `inject(Renderer2)` /
  `inject(ElementRef)` calls itself, in the same class-field initializer
  position; it now passes the resolved instance into the runtime factory
  (`createRozieAttrApplier(inject(Renderer2))`) instead of resolving it
  internally. Neither factory ever calls `inject()` or names an Angular
  type — both accept a structural interface (`RozieAttrRenderer`,
  `RozieHostRef`) — so this package still never resolves an Angular DI token
  itself, and the peer-keyed cross-package instance-identity hazard
  (`71dff1d5`) is structurally unreachable rather than merely tested against.

  Merge semantics, applied DOM output, and evaluation order are unchanged: a
  wrapper's own static `class` survives a spread that also sets `class`; a
  dropped `class`/`style` key removes only the tokens/properties this applier
  previously applied; an applied style still lands with `!important` priority,
  winning the last-write race against Angular's own `[ngClass]`/`ɵɵstyleMap`
  re-apply.

  A component using neither `r-bind` spread nor `$attrs` carries no new
  reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` — the import gate is keyed on whether
  the emitter actually pushed the corresponding field declaration, independent
  of the two Tier-1 gates (`rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr`/`rozieToken`,
  `RozieSlot`).

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- `@rozie/runtime-lit` gains a new public export, `RozieSlotDistributor` — a reactive
  controller that performs manual slot assignment for a Lit shadow root, used wherever a
  component needs to route projected children into loop-generated `<slot>` targets
  (e.g. carousel slides). Adopting manual `slotAssignment` turns OFF the browser's
  automatic Text-node projection for that shadow root: raw text children must now be
  assigned to a slot explicitly, and any code reading `assignedNodes()` needs to guard
  for the manual-assignment case. A host that adopts the controller needs its
  `shadowRootOptions` typed as `ShadowRootInit`.

  `@rozie/core` adds two new compile-time diagnostics and one new template sigil:
  - **ROZ148** — flags a prop whose name collides with an emitted callback name, before
    it becomes a runtime shadowing bug on a target that lowers the prop to a method.
  - **ROZ210** — flags a reserved slot name so it can't silently collide with an
    internally-generated one.
  - **`$slotted`** — a new member sigil authors can read inside a loop to get the live,
    reactively-assigned elements projected into that iteration's slot.

  `@rozie/{cli,unplugin,babel-plugin}` bundle `@rozie/core`'s compiler, so this release
  carries the same diagnostics and `$slotted` lowering through to every consumer of
  those packages — the compiler itself moved even though none of these three changed
  their own source. `$slotted` lowers to a reactive assigned-elements signal on the Lit
  target (backed by `RozieSlotDistributor`, gated behind a new `shouldDistributeSlots`
  check so it only emits where a loop actually needs manual slot assignment) and to a
  plain `[]` on the five hostless targets (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular), where
  there's no shadow root to distribute into.

  `@rozie/runtime-{react,vue,svelte,solid,keynav-core}` are version-aligned to 0.5.0 by
  the changesets `fixed` group riding the `runtime-lit` minor above — this is a
  version-alignment release only; none of these five packages has a source or behavior
  change in this wave.

  `@rozie-ui/date-picker-*` (all six targets) — day and caption labels are now derived
  from `Intl`, with a new `labels` prop for overriding them; range-span selections now
  validate against `disabled` dates; and the calendar header adds drill-in/drill-out
  navigation verbs.

  `@rozie-ui/embla-*` (all six targets) adopts `$slotted` for its carousel slides. On
  the Lit target specifically, this closes a real projection gap: raw `slot="slide"`
  children are now distributed per-iteration instead of only the first iteration
  claiming them.

  `@rozie-ui/{combobox,command-palette,data-table,sortable-list,tags,toast}-lit` are
  regenerated against the new Lit emitter output above — each already used a loop-slot
  pattern that now runs through `RozieSlotDistributor` / `$slotted` instead of the prior
  ad hoc approach, with no observable behavior change for existing consumers of these
  specific leaves.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated from a fixed `Carousel.rozie` source (no emitter change reaches Angular in this wave). The `startIndex` prop's JSDoc now correctly says "Init-only" instead of the stale "Runtime-updatable" (WR-01) — the D1 init-only contract shipped in 0.1.3, but the prop's own doc comment (copied verbatim into IDE hover) was missed. No runtime behavior change; no API surface change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated from a fixed `Carousel.rozie` source (no emitter change reaches Angular in this wave). The selected index now survives `reInit`: `startIndex` is stripped from every reInit payload after the raw `options` spread, so a runtime option flip (e.g. toggling `loop`) no longer teleports the carousel back to `startIndex`. **Deliberate behavior change to a published verb:** no-arg `reInitCarousel()` now preserves position instead of resetting to `startIndex` — documented in `embla.md`. Scheduled mount work (two `requestAnimationFrame` handles + a macrotask) is now cancelled on teardown, and both engines are nulled after `destroy()`, so all 14 `$expose` verbs fall through their guards after unmount. A runtime `thumbnails` toggle now actually builds the thumb engine (deferred/idempotent double-schedule).
- Docs truth pass: the runtime-updatable contract (17 of 20 props; `startIndex`/`plugins`/`options` marked construction-only, with reasons), the five previously-missing handle verbs (`scrollProgress`/`slidesInView`/`slidesNotInView`/`previousScrollSnap`/`getPlugins`), a Slots section (`<ng-template #slide>`/content projection), and a filled Events table.
- No API surface change. This leaf's only dependency remains `tslib`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/embla` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0` on-disk number was never published; it is a changesets ripple from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps, not release history.

  `embla-carousel ^8.6` and `embla-carousel-autoplay ^8.6` are `peerDependencies` — the consumer installs them; nothing is bundled. There is no engine CSS to import: the carousel skeleton ships scoped and tokenised inside the component. This leaf's only dependency is `tslib` — no `@rozie/runtime-*` dependency, so it is unaffected by the `@rozie/runtime-*` 0.2.2 bump landing in this same wave.

  Two built-in navigation fixes are now VR-locked in this release: Embla's `slides` option is pinned to `.rozie-embla__slide` (Lit's trailing declarative-mode `<slot/>` used to be counted as a phantom slide, collapsing `scrollSnapList()` to one snap), and `selectThumb` no longer calls the Embla-8-removed `clickAllowed()`.
