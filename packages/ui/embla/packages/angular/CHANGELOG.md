### Patch Changes

- 6943820: Lit and Angular dropped every leading comment on a top-level declaration promoted into
  the component class — 1370 apiece across the shipped corpus. Both emitters build each
  class member as a hand-built string (`generate(decl)` / `renderExpression` / a rebuilt
  arrow or `t.classMethod`), and none of those carries the STATEMENT's own comments, so an
  author's documentation simply vanished from the emitted component.

  Both now run a printed-comment ledger keyed on comment OBJECT IDENTITY. Identity rather
  than source offsets is load-bearing: a `.rzts` script partial is parsed as its own file,
  so its comment offsets collide with unrelated host comments. A per-branch rule cannot
  work here at all, because @babel/parser attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements
  to BOTH neighbours at once — whichever side a local rule picks, the other side either
  double-prints it or drops it.

  Three properties this needed, each found by measuring the corpus rather than by reading
  code:

  **It looks back, not just down.** Each statement claims the PREVIOUS statement's
  still-unclaimed trailing comments as well as its own leading ones, rendering both above
  its member. Inline, one parse hands the same comment object to both sides, so it prints
  once. Across a `.rzts` splice boundary the successor comes from a different parse with
  nothing attached, and the previous statement's trailing side is the only place the
  comment exists. Without this the inline host printed a comment the partial-inlined host
  could not, and the partial-vs-inline byte-identity guards went red.

  **The ledger spans the import block.** A comment between the last import and the first
  promoted declaration is printed by the module-scope import generation — a separate
  printer with its own dedup set. Unseeded, 132 comments printed twice on Lit and 155 on
  Angular. Seeding from every comment merely ATTACHED to an import node over-corrected and
  lost 16, since a comment can hang off a node the block never prints; the seed is taken
  from what the block actually emitted.

  **It unclaims.** A statement can be consumed by another pass — a `$computed`, a lifecycle
  hook, a `$provide` directive — and produce no class member at all. When the flush finds
  no target it releases the claim so whichever printer does emit that statement still
  renders its comments. Claiming without emitting is how a ledger silently drops comments,
  which is strictly worse than double-printing, and this is why both targets report zero
  lost despite several statement kinds never reaching a ledger-owned array.

  Net effect: 5311 comments restored across 53 Lit leaves and 5266 across the Angular
  leaves, with ZERO comments dropped and ZERO non-comment bytes changed, plus 16
  pre-existing double-prints fixed on each target (a comment that had been emitted both at
  module scope and again inside the mount hook). Verified by parsing every file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides — never by reading the diff.

  Emitted code is unchanged in every case; this is documentation fidelity only.

  Eighteen further Lit/Angular leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are
  deliberately absent from the front matter — dialog, lexical, listbox, maplibre,
  number-field, pagination, resizable, slider and switch (both targets) are all in
  `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and listing an ignored package beside a
  non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- f3266db: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken`
  alongside the existing `RozieSlot` marker directive. The Angular target used to
  inline a copy of these three helpers (and, for `rozieToken`, its
  `globalThis`-backed cross-package registry) as module-scope declarations in
  _every_ emitted component that wrapped an interpolation or used the
  `$provide`/`$inject` context primitive — duplicating the same ~40 lines across 21
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaves. The emitter now imports the helpers from
  `@rozie/runtime-angular` instead.

  Behavior is unchanged: the delegating `rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr` class methods
  Angular templates call are untouched, `rozieToken`'s `globalThis`-backed identity
  guarantee is preserved verbatim, and a component using none of the three continues
  to carry no reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` at all. `number-field` and `otp`
  (previously the only two Angular leaves with no existing `@rozie/runtime-angular`
  dependency) now declare it in both `package.json` and `ng-package.json`'s
  `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.

- 78d5b5b: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `createRozieAttrApplier` and
  `createRozieHostAttrsReader` alongside the existing `RozieSlot`,
  `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken` exports. The Angular target
  used to inline a copy of the `r-bind`/`$attrs` spread attribute applier and
  host-attribute reader (~85 lines: three `WeakMap` prev-state caches, the
  class/style merge logic, and the host-attribute fold) as a private-field
  IIFE pair in _every_ emitted component that used `r-bind` spread or read
  `$attrs` — 158 tracked emitted files, of which 23 are shipped
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaf sources across 21 leaves.

  The emitted component keeps performing both `inject(Renderer2)` /
  `inject(ElementRef)` calls itself, in the same class-field initializer
  position; it now passes the resolved instance into the runtime factory
  (`createRozieAttrApplier(inject(Renderer2))`) instead of resolving it
  internally. Neither factory ever calls `inject()` or names an Angular
  type — both accept a structural interface (`RozieAttrRenderer`,
  `RozieHostRef`) — so this package still never resolves an Angular DI token
  itself, and the peer-keyed cross-package instance-identity hazard
  (`71dff1d5`) is structurally unreachable rather than merely tested against.

  Merge semantics, applied DOM output, and evaluation order are unchanged: a
  wrapper's own static `class` survives a spread that also sets `class`; a
  dropped `class`/`style` key removes only the tokens/properties this applier
  previously applied; an applied style still lands with `!important` priority,
  winning the last-write race against Angular's own `[ngClass]`/`ɵɵstyleMap`
  re-apply.

  A component using neither `r-bind` spread nor `$attrs` carries no new
  reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` — the import gate is keyed on whether
  the emitter actually pushed the corresponding field declaration, independent
  of the two Tier-1 gates (`rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr`/`rozieToken`,
  `RozieSlot`).

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- `@rozie/runtime-lit` gains a new public export, `RozieSlotDistributor` — a reactive
  controller that performs manual slot assignment for a Lit shadow root, used wherever a
  component needs to route projected children into loop-generated `<slot>` targets
  (e.g. carousel slides). Adopting manual `slotAssignment` turns OFF the browser's
  automatic Text-node projection for that shadow root: raw text children must now be
  assigned to a slot explicitly, and any code reading `assignedNodes()` needs to guard
  for the manual-assignment case. A host that adopts the controller needs its
  `shadowRootOptions` typed as `ShadowRootInit`.

  `@rozie/core` adds two new compile-time diagnostics and one new template sigil:
  - **ROZ148** — flags a prop whose name collides with an emitted callback name, before
    it becomes a runtime shadowing bug on a target that lowers the prop to a method.
  - **ROZ210** — flags a reserved slot name so it can't silently collide with an
    internally-generated one.
  - **`$slotted`** — a new member sigil authors can read inside a loop to get the live,
    reactively-assigned elements projected into that iteration's slot.

  `@rozie/{cli,unplugin,babel-plugin}` bundle `@rozie/core`'s compiler, so this release
  carries the same diagnostics and `$slotted` lowering through to every consumer of
  those packages — the compiler itself moved even though none of these three changed
  their own source. `$slotted` lowers to a reactive assigned-elements signal on the Lit
  target (backed by `RozieSlotDistributor`, gated behind a new `shouldDistributeSlots`
  check so it only emits where a loop actually needs manual slot assignment) and to a
  plain `[]` on the five hostless targets (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular), where
  there's no shadow root to distribute into.

  `@rozie/runtime-{react,vue,svelte,solid,keynav-core}` are version-aligned to 0.5.0 by
  the changesets `fixed` group riding the `runtime-lit` minor above — this is a
  version-alignment release only; none of these five packages has a source or behavior
  change in this wave.

  `@rozie-ui/date-picker-*` (all six targets) — day and caption labels are now derived
  from `Intl`, with a new `labels` prop for overriding them; range-span selections now
  validate against `disabled` dates; and the calendar header adds drill-in/drill-out
  navigation verbs.

  `@rozie-ui/embla-*` (all six targets) adopts `$slotted` for its carousel slides. On
  the Lit target specifically, this closes a real projection gap: raw `slot="slide"`
  children are now distributed per-iteration instead of only the first iteration
  claiming them.

  `@rozie-ui/{combobox,command-palette,data-table,sortable-list,tags,toast}-lit` are
  regenerated against the new Lit emitter output above — each already used a loop-slot
  pattern that now runs through `RozieSlotDistributor` / `$slotted` instead of the prior
  ad hoc approach, with no observable behavior change for existing consumers of these
  specific leaves.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated from a fixed `Carousel.rozie` source (no emitter change reaches Angular in this wave). The `startIndex` prop's JSDoc now correctly says "Init-only" instead of the stale "Runtime-updatable" (WR-01) — the D1 init-only contract shipped in 0.1.3, but the prop's own doc comment (copied verbatim into IDE hover) was missed. No runtime behavior change; no API surface change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated from a fixed `Carousel.rozie` source (no emitter change reaches Angular in this wave). The selected index now survives `reInit`: `startIndex` is stripped from every reInit payload after the raw `options` spread, so a runtime option flip (e.g. toggling `loop`) no longer teleports the carousel back to `startIndex`. **Deliberate behavior change to a published verb:** no-arg `reInitCarousel()` now preserves position instead of resetting to `startIndex` — documented in `embla.md`. Scheduled mount work (two `requestAnimationFrame` handles + a macrotask) is now cancelled on teardown, and both engines are nulled after `destroy()`, so all 14 `$expose` verbs fall through their guards after unmount. A runtime `thumbnails` toggle now actually builds the thumb engine (deferred/idempotent double-schedule).
- Docs truth pass: the runtime-updatable contract (17 of 20 props; `startIndex`/`plugins`/`options` marked construction-only, with reasons), the five previously-missing handle verbs (`scrollProgress`/`slidesInView`/`slidesNotInView`/`previousScrollSnap`/`getPlugins`), a Slots section (`<ng-template #slide>`/content projection), and a filled Events table.
- No API surface change. This leaf's only dependency remains `tslib`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/embla` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0` on-disk number was never published; it is a changesets ripple from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps, not release history.

  `embla-carousel ^8.6` and `embla-carousel-autoplay ^8.6` are `peerDependencies` — the consumer installs them; nothing is bundled. There is no engine CSS to import: the carousel skeleton ships scoped and tokenised inside the component. This leaf's only dependency is `tslib` — no `@rozie/runtime-*` dependency, so it is unaffected by the `@rozie/runtime-*` 0.2.2 bump landing in this same wave.

  Two built-in navigation fixes are now VR-locked in this release: Embla's `slides` option is pinned to `.rozie-embla__slide` (Lit's trailing declarative-mode `<slot/>` used to be counted as a phantom slide, collapsing `scrollSnapList()` to one snap), and `selectThumb` no longer calls the Embla-8-removed `clickAllowed()`.
