# @rozie-ui/embla-angular

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/embla` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0` on-disk number was never published; it is a changesets ripple from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps, not release history.

  `embla-carousel ^8.6` and `embla-carousel-autoplay ^8.6` are `peerDependencies` — the consumer installs them; nothing is bundled. There is no engine CSS to import: the carousel skeleton ships scoped and tokenised inside the component. This leaf's only dependency is `tslib` — no `@rozie/runtime-*` dependency, so it is unaffected by the `@rozie/runtime-*` 0.2.2 bump landing in this same wave.

  Two built-in navigation fixes are now VR-locked in this release: Embla's `slides` option is pinned to `.rozie-embla__slide` (Lit's trailing declarative-mode `<slot/>` used to be counted as a phantom slide, collapsing `scrollSnapList()` to one snap), and `selectThumb` no longer calls the Embla-8-removed `clickAllowed()`.
