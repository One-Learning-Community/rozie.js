## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- c362398: The npm package now includes `CHANGELOG.md`. It was written for every release but left out of the tarball, because npm no longer adds a changelog by itself, so a behaviour change recorded there (such as the 0.7.0 combobox Ctrl/Cmd/Alt+Enter change) was invisible to anyone reading the installed package.

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- a9d67cb: Typed public surface, phase 1: a component can now declare real TypeScript types for its events, slot parameters and imperative handle, and a consumer on any target sees them instead of `any`. See the new guide, "Typed public surface".

  Four opt-in authoring features (a component that uses none of them compiles exactly as before; all are types-only, with no runtime change on any target):
  - `<types>` block: type-only statements (`import type`, `interface`, `type`, and `export` of those) hoisted into every target and re-exported from the package entry. Anything else is an error (ROZ019, ROZ020). A `<types>` import that clashes with a `<script>` import is ROZ024; an identical duplicate is dropped silently. A `<types>` name that collides with a generated name (`<Name>Props`, `<Name>Handle`, `Rozie<Name>EventMap`, slot context interfaces, …), with a name the compiled module imports (a `<components>` key, its `<Local>Handle`, or a framework / `@rozie/runtime-*` import such as `ReactNode` or `TemplateRef`, reserved on every target), or with a top-level `<script>` declaration is ROZ025.
  - `<emits>` block: `{ name: { payload?: '<type>', docs?: {...} } }`. When present it is the complete list: an undeclared `$emit` is an error (ROZ151), reported at the `$emit` call, and a declared event that is never emitted is a warning (ROZ152), reported at its `<emits>` entry. A `$emit` whose argument count does not match the declared payload is a warning (ROZ157), reported at the call. Invalid entries (including a repeated event name or `payload`/`docs` key), types and docs are ROZ021, ROZ022 and ROZ023. React and Solid get `onX?: (payload: P) => void`, Vue a typed `defineEmits`, Svelte a lowercase `onx` callback, Angular `output<P>()`, and Lit a `CustomEvent<P>` with a generated `Rozie<Name>EventMap` and typed `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` overloads.
  - `<slot :param-types="{ row: 'Row' }">` types a slot parameter (unknown key ROZ153, malformed value ROZ154).
  - `$expose(verbs, signatures)`: a compile-time-only second argument typing the handle (unknown verb ROZ155, malformed ROZ156). The signature strings are stripped from every emitted module. A verb without a signature keeps its implementation's own types when it has them (a return-type annotation or an annotated `const`, in `<script lang="ts">`) on every target; only a fully untyped verb is `(...args: any[]) => any`.

  Also in this release:
  - The component manifest (`rozie-manifest.json`) is schema v2 and carries emit payloads, expose signatures, the `<types>` text and slot `:param-types`. The reader still accepts v1, so composing an already-published v1 package keeps working. Composing a package whose leaves ship a v2 manifest (`@rozie-ui/popover`, `@rozie-ui/combobox`, …) from your own `.rozie` requires `@rozie/*` at or above this release; a compiler that is too old now says so in ROZ988 (upgrade the toolchain) instead of advising a reinstall of the primitive.
  - `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars now carry `<types>` and type slots and events exactly as each compiled module does. Apart from `<types>`, these changes apply to every component, not only to ones that use the new features: Solid `<slot>Slot` props and JSX.Element shapes; Svelte Snippet shapes and lowercase handler names; no spurious `render<X>` props on Vue, Angular and Lit (Lit declares its slot receivers on the element class instead); no `on<X>` props on Lit; and on Angular, every component with events loses its spurious `on<Event>` props, and the declared class gets typed `OutputEmitterRef<T>` outputs from the same derivation as the compiled `output()` fields (`T` is the declared payload, otherwise `void`, or `unknown` when an untyped `$emit` passes a payload). The `<Name>Handle` of an `$expose` component now keeps the type of a verb declared as an annotated `const` (`const add: AddFn = …`) instead of `(...args: any[]) => any` (or the implementation's own signature). A Solid scoped default slot now accepts a function child.
  - Text such as `<script`, `<style`, `<title` or `<textarea` inside a `<types>`, `<emits>`, `<props>`, `<data>`, `<listeners>` or `<components>` body (in a comment, a docs string, or a generic like `Array<Style>`) no longer desynchronises the block splitter. Those bodies are now opaque to the HTML tokenizer.

  Untyped-handler convergence (the one planned typing change for components that do not opt in; the sidecar fixes above reach them too): an untyped event handler is now `(...args: any[]) => void` on every target. The shared `.d.ts` sidecar, Solid and Svelte used to emit `unknown[]`, which rejected handlers written with a concrete parameter type; React already used `any[]`. The generated sources of the Solid and Svelte leaves (and the React `.d.ts`) change accordingly, hence the patch bumps. `@rozie-ui/sortable-list-solid` and `@rozie-ui/switch-solid` also pick up the scoped-default-slot function-child fix.

  `@rozie-ui/popover-*` and `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar-*` adopt the features and are bumped minor, because typed events can reject a previously accepted wrong-typed handler:
  - popover: the `anchor` slot context is typed (including the new `panelId: string`) and the handle (`show`, `hide`, `toggle`, `reposition`) is typed. Its open state's change event is the `open` model's (Lit: `open-change`, now in `RoziePopoverEventMap` as `CustomEvent<boolean>`).
  - fullcalendar: 11 typed events (for example `eventClick` with `jsEvent: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent`, and `unselect` with `jsEvent: UIEvent | null`), 10 typed portal slot arguments and 16 typed handle verbs. The `<types>` names are re-exported from every package entry, and the package barrels re-export the handle types and Lit event maps.
  - Both families generate their README event tables from `<emits>` and no longer ship `scripts/event-manifest.mjs`.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- 4f2148d: **Fixed: published Solid leaves now ship compiled JavaScript for `import`/`require`, with JSX
  kept only under the `solid` export condition.**

  Every `@rozie-ui/*-solid` leaf with markup previously shipped Solid JSX inside
  `dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` under a plain `import`/`require` (`chartjs-solid` renders no markup of its
  own, but ships the same corrected export shape for consistency with its siblings). That is not
  valid JavaScript on its own — a default `vite-plugin-solid` setup
  fails with "JSX syntax is disabled" (the plugin only transforms `.[mc]?[jt]sx` files), and any
  bundler without a Solid plugin fails outright. The only way to consume these packages was to
  manually point `vite-plugin-solid` at the package's `.mjs` files inside `node_modules` — a
  workaround, not a supported shape.

  New export shape (the standard one for a published Solid library):
  - `import` / `require` → `dist/<entry>.{mjs,cjs}`, compiled to plain DOM output by
    `babel-preset-solid`. Any bundler consumes this with no Solid plugin at all.
  - `solid` (export condition) → `dist/source/<entry>.jsx`, JSX kept intact. `vite-plugin-solid`
    and SolidStart resolve this condition first and compile it themselves for their own mode (DOM /
    SSR / hydration).

  **If you were using the `extensions: ['.mjs']` / `node_modules` `include` workaround with
  `vite-plugin-solid` to consume one of these packages, remove it — it is no longer needed** and a
  default `vite-plugin-solid` setup now resolves the `solid` condition correctly on its own. No
  public API change on any of these leaves.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Declare `@rozie/runtime-*` as `workspace:^` instead of `workspace:*`.

  `workspace:*` publishes as an **exact** pin on the runtime version, so every toolchain bump forced a republish of every leaf that carried one — 76 of the 92 packages in the previous release wave had no source change at all. `workspace:^` publishes as `^<version>`, which a later patch-level runtime still satisfies, so an unchanged leaf stays valid instead of being dragged along.

  This is not a new policy: it is the caret policy already documented and applied by nine family codegen scripts ("bake the caret policy now so `workspace:*` is normalized to `workspace:^`"). It was simply never applied to the leaves whose codegen does not write `package.json`. The Svelte leaves were already fully aligned; the Vue leaves were aligned apart from three. This brings the React, Solid, Lit, and Angular leaves in line, so all six targets now state the dependency the same way.

  The `@rozie/*` toolchain packages keep `workspace:*` deliberately — they are a changesets `fixed` group and always version in lockstep, so an exact pin is correct there.

  This release still republishes these leaves, because their published `package.json` genuinely changes. The benefit is on every release after it.

### Patch Changes

- eb280c9: No API change. Internal helpers that read `$portals.<name>` now live at component scope
  instead of inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook, now that quick 260829-cd4 hoists the
  emitter-synthesized `$portals` closure to component scope on all six targets.

  This unwinds the `$portals` mount-scope workarounds in three shipped `@rozie-ui`
  components (of the five originally targeted — see the CodeMirror note below) carried
  before that emitter fix landed:
  - **`@rozie-ui/tiptap`** — `makeNodeView`/`makeNodeViewExtensions` read `$portals.nodeView`
    directly instead of taking it as an injected parameter.
  - **`@rozie-ui/rete`** (`NodeType`) — the `#body` portal-mount closure is a top-level
    function instead of a null-let bridge assigned inside `$onMount`.
  - **`@rozie-ui/chartjs`** (and its 8 per-type variants, generated from the same source) —
    `buildConfig` and its click/hover/tooltip helpers are top-level; `$onMount` now only
    captures the canvas ref, constructs the `Chart` instance, and tears it down.

  `@rozie-ui/maplibre`'s per-framework leaves are changesets-ignored (deliberately
  unpublished) even though the marker/popup/interactive-layer reconcile unwind landed and
  is included in the source diff — no leaf version bump applies.

  `@rozie-ui/rete`'s sibling `FlowCanvas` component was investigated and found
  correct-by-design (its reconcilers are rooted in a `$refs` read that must stay
  `$onMount`-scoped under ROZ123) — only its stale comment was corrected, no behavior change.

  **`@rozie-ui/codemirror` REVERTED, not shipped.** The relocation was implemented, gated
  green (build/test/typecheck), and committed, but the full Docker VR union caught a
  React-only regression it introduced: the CM6 `Compartment` instances (`themeCompartment`
  et al.) lost their `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` wrapping and became a
  per-render `new Compartment()` once `buildState` (which reads them) moved out of
  `$onMount` to a top-level `useCallback` — an emitter memoization-heuristic gap, not a
  `.rozie`-source-fixable issue (SCOPE FENCE: no emitter code changed in this quick). Two
  React `code-mirror.spec.ts` tests failed (theme-toggle class never changing; an
  extensions-toggle readOnly reconfigure never taking effect) while all five other targets
  stayed green. The commit was reverted; CodeMirror.rozie and its six leaves are unchanged
  from `main` before this quick. Recorded as a follow-up for the emitter team, not
  worked around here.

  Several stale comments across the touched files claimed `$emit` and/or `$slots` also
  forced mount scope. Neither ever did, on any target — those comments are corrected too.

  No emitter code changed in this patch. `@rozie/core` is not bumped.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

### Patch Changes

- Debut release of `@rozie-ui/chartjs` — Rozie's cross-framework port of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), the most-used canvas charting library on the web. One `.rozie` source ships idiomatic React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Solid, and Lit components with no per-framework wrapper boilerplate.

  Each of the six packages exports **nine components**: the generic `Chart` — whose `type` prop switches the chart kind across the whole Chart.js controller set (`line`/`bar`/`pie`/`doughnut`/`radar`/`polarArea`/`scatter`/`bubble`) — plus eight **per-type components** (`Line`, `Bar`, `Pie`, `Doughnut`, `PolarArea`, `Radar`, `Scatter`, `Bubble`), each pinning its own `type` and registering only its own Chart.js controller/element/scale set so importing one is tree-shakable by construction. The compiled React/Solid/Lit packages additionally expose a per-variant deep-import subpath (`@rozie-ui/chartjs-react/line`, etc.) for guaranteed chunk isolation; the source-shipped Vue/Svelte/Angular packages tree-shake per-type imports natively.

  Surface: 11 props (`data`/`options`/`type`/`height`/`width`/`plugins`/`updateMode`/`redraw`/`ariaLabel`/`datasetIdKey`/`destroyDelay`), 3 structured events (`click`/`hover`/`datasetClick`, composed over any consumer-supplied `options.onClick`/`onHover` without clobbering it), a 15-verb imperative handle (lifecycle/redraw verbs plus dataset-visibility, active-element, and metadata verbs — including the marquee `toBase64Image` PNG export), and two slots (a non-portal `fallback` slot for in-canvas a11y content, and an external-HTML `tooltip` portal slot driven by Chart.js's external-tooltip handler). `data` reconciles in place (tweening point-to-point); `type`/`plugins` changes — and `data` changes when `redraw` is set — re-create the instance, since Chart.js has no stable runtime type/plugin-swap.

  Requires the `chart.js` engine (`^4`) as a required peer dependency alongside the framework peer.

  A deep pre-release audit (`.planning/quick/260810-usc-chartjs-debut-shore-up/AUDIT.md`) traced the full surface against all four docs pages and all four VR specs before this release: two DOCS-DRIFT findings were fixed (a stale "auto-registers every controller" claim in `docs/components/chartjs.md` that contradicted both the source and the rest of the same page, and a stale hand-counted `Chart.rozie` header comment), and several COVERAGE-GAP findings were closed by a new family test suite (`packages/ui/chartjs/tests/{surface,sidecars}.test.ts`, replacing the previously test-less `vitest run --passWithNoTests`) and new VR legs exercising the imperative handle and the composed-`onClick` contract. Zero SOURCE-BUG and zero EMITTER-BACKLOG findings — no public surface changed, so this debut ships as a patch.

  The `-vue` leaf ships a JetBrains `web-types.json` and the `-lit` leaf ships a Custom Elements Manifest (`custom-elements.json`), both covering all nine components and both generated by the family codegen from the same lowered IR the READMEs use.
