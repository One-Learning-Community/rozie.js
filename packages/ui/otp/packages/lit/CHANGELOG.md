### Patch Changes

- 6943820: Lit and Angular dropped every leading comment on a top-level declaration promoted into
  the component class — 1370 apiece across the shipped corpus. Both emitters build each
  class member as a hand-built string (`generate(decl)` / `renderExpression` / a rebuilt
  arrow or `t.classMethod`), and none of those carries the STATEMENT's own comments, so an
  author's documentation simply vanished from the emitted component.

  Both now run a printed-comment ledger keyed on comment OBJECT IDENTITY. Identity rather
  than source offsets is load-bearing: a `.rzts` script partial is parsed as its own file,
  so its comment offsets collide with unrelated host comments. A per-branch rule cannot
  work here at all, because @babel/parser attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements
  to BOTH neighbours at once — whichever side a local rule picks, the other side either
  double-prints it or drops it.

  Three properties this needed, each found by measuring the corpus rather than by reading
  code:

  **It looks back, not just down.** Each statement claims the PREVIOUS statement's
  still-unclaimed trailing comments as well as its own leading ones, rendering both above
  its member. Inline, one parse hands the same comment object to both sides, so it prints
  once. Across a `.rzts` splice boundary the successor comes from a different parse with
  nothing attached, and the previous statement's trailing side is the only place the
  comment exists. Without this the inline host printed a comment the partial-inlined host
  could not, and the partial-vs-inline byte-identity guards went red.

  **The ledger spans the import block.** A comment between the last import and the first
  promoted declaration is printed by the module-scope import generation — a separate
  printer with its own dedup set. Unseeded, 132 comments printed twice on Lit and 155 on
  Angular. Seeding from every comment merely ATTACHED to an import node over-corrected and
  lost 16, since a comment can hang off a node the block never prints; the seed is taken
  from what the block actually emitted.

  **It unclaims.** A statement can be consumed by another pass — a `$computed`, a lifecycle
  hook, a `$provide` directive — and produce no class member at all. When the flush finds
  no target it releases the claim so whichever printer does emit that statement still
  renders its comments. Claiming without emitting is how a ledger silently drops comments,
  which is strictly worse than double-printing, and this is why both targets report zero
  lost despite several statement kinds never reaching a ledger-owned array.

  Net effect: 5311 comments restored across 53 Lit leaves and 5266 across the Angular
  leaves, with ZERO comments dropped and ZERO non-comment bytes changed, plus 16
  pre-existing double-prints fixed on each target (a comment that had been emitted both at
  module scope and again inside the mount hook). Verified by parsing every file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides — never by reading the diff.

  Emitted code is unchanged in every case; this is documentation fidelity only.

  Eighteen further Lit/Angular leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are
  deliberately absent from the front matter — dialog, lexical, listbox, maplibre,
  number-field, pagination, resizable, slider and switch (both targets) are all in
  `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and listing an ignored package beside a
  non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-lit@0.6.0

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- The vendored `internal/otpWrite.ts` write model (IN-04) now early-returns `null` from `planWrite` at the degenerate `length: 0` boundary instead of computing `landed: -1` (a boundary violation of the documented `OtpWrite.landed` contract; unreachable through this component with a sane `length`, but this is an exported pure function with its own test suite). No observable runtime behavior change for a correctly-configured `Otp`; no API surface change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. All input now routes through one clamped write model (`src/internal/otpWrite.ts`, vendored through codegen): SMS-autofill, swipe, and IME-commit multi-character input is distributed across cells instead of collapsing to the last character, and the fill point is clamped to the first empty cell so a write can no longer desync from the rendered value. Emit hygiene fixed: `change` fires only on an actual value transition, and `complete` fires only on the not-full → full transition (fixes a re-fire on an in-place edit of an already-full code, and the `length: 0` `clear()` edge). Added an `onPointerUp` re-select so a pointer-placed caret still overwrites the cell on mouse input.
- A nullable attribute bound to a null-valued primitive prop read is now dropped instead of rendered — previously a nullable prop could render the literal string `null` through the attribute binding.
- `r-for` loop keys are no longer leaked as literal DOM attributes on the emitted per-cell elements.
- Docs corrections: the emit contract, the write model, the keyboard/paste/multi-character-input rows, and the accessibility section now describe the shipped behavior. The leaf README renders a prose line instead of a headerless empty Slots table.
- No API surface change: 8 props / 2 events / a 2-verb (`focus`, `clear`) imperative handle, unchanged.
- Updated dependencies
  - @rozie/runtime-lit@0.2.2

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/otp` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0`/`0.1.1` on-disk numbers were never published; they are changesets ripples from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps, not release history.

  This release adds behavior-VR coverage (paste distribution, backspace navigation, arrow/Home/End movement, mask rendering, disabled state, filled-cell overwrite) as test-only hardening — no API change. The surface is unchanged: 8 props / 2 events / a 2-verb (`focus`, `clear`) imperative handle.

  The `@rozie/runtime-lit` dependency now resolves to `0.2.2` (array-form `:style` merge).
