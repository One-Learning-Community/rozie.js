## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- 57607be: **Fixed: published Solid leaves now ship compiled JavaScript for `import`/`require`, with JSX
  kept only under the `solid` export condition.**

  Every `@rozie-ui/*-solid` leaf with markup previously shipped Solid JSX inside
  `dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` under a plain `import`/`require` (`chartjs-solid` renders no markup of its
  own, but ships the same corrected export shape for consistency with its siblings). That is not
  valid JavaScript on its own — a default `vite-plugin-solid` setup
  fails with "JSX syntax is disabled" (the plugin only transforms `.[mc]?[jt]sx` files), and any
  bundler without a Solid plugin fails outright. The only way to consume these packages was to
  manually point `vite-plugin-solid` at the package's `.mjs` files inside `node_modules` — a
  workaround, not a supported shape.

  New export shape (the standard one for a published Solid library):
  - `import` / `require` → `dist/<entry>.{mjs,cjs}`, compiled to plain DOM output by
    `babel-preset-solid`. Any bundler consumes this with no Solid plugin at all.
  - `solid` (export condition) → `dist/source/<entry>.jsx`, JSX kept intact. `vite-plugin-solid`
    and SolidStart resolve this condition first and compile it themselves for their own mode (DOM /
    SSR / hydration).

  **If you were using the `extensions: ['.mjs']` / `node_modules` `include` workaround with
  `vite-plugin-solid` to consume one of these packages, remove it — it is no longer needed** and a
  default `vite-plugin-solid` setup now resolves the `solid` condition correctly on its own. No
  public API change on any of these leaves.

- 57607be: Design-system bridges now yield to a token set on any ancestor, and apply correctly on Lit.

  Each family's `bootstrap`/`material`/`shadcn` theme bridge previously assigned the tokens it
  maps directly on the component's own class. In CSS, a value an element declares for itself
  always beats one it would inherit — so with a bridge imported, a public
  `--rozie-<family>-*` token set on an ancestor (`:root`, `.dark`, a themed wrapper) had no effect;
  only setting it on the component element itself worked. On Lit specifically, where the
  component's class lives inside a shadow root that a document-level bridge selector can never
  match, every bridge was completely inert.

  Every read site that base.css gives a default, or a bridge maps, is now public-token-first, then
  a private wiring name, then the inline default — e.g.
  `var(--rozie-switch-on-bg, var(--rsw-on-bg, #0066cc))` — so a value set on any ancestor always
  wins over a bridge's own mapping, and a public accent set on an ancestor now also recolours the
  bridge-mapped tokens that default to it (ring colour, check colour, etc). Each bridge now
  redeclares only the wiring for the tokens it maps, with the design system's own variable as the
  fallback, resolved on the component itself — so it follows the nearest theme scope rather than
  only ever reading `:root`, and a Lit host in the document's light DOM is matched directly by its
  tag. Zero-import rendering is unchanged in every case: with nothing imported, every chain still
  resolves to the same built-in default it always has.

  **Behaviour changes a consumer can see:** with a bridge imported, a `--rozie-<family>-*` token
  set on any ancestor now wins over the bridge's mapping (previously it only won when set directly
  on the component element). On Lit, the bridges now actually apply (previously inert); a Lit
  component nested inside another shadow root reads the design system's variables at the document
  root.

  **`@rozie-ui/rete`** additionally fixes its dark palette specifically: `FlowCanvas`'s
  OS-dark palette was declared directly on the canvas element (competing with base.css's own
  `.dark`/OS-dark declarations on the same element), so any ancestor override of a
  `--rozie-flow-*` token was dead in OS-dark mode even with nothing else imported. The palette now
  lives at the document root at zero specificity, so an ancestor override reaches it in every mode.

  No component source behaviour changes beyond the CSS cascade described above; this is a pure
  theming/cascade fix in every family listed.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Declare `@rozie/runtime-*` as `workspace:^` instead of `workspace:*`.

  `workspace:*` publishes as an **exact** pin on the runtime version, so every toolchain bump forced a republish of every leaf that carried one — 76 of the 92 packages in the previous release wave had no source change at all. `workspace:^` publishes as `^<version>`, which a later patch-level runtime still satisfies, so an unchanged leaf stays valid instead of being dragged along.

  This is not a new policy: it is the caret policy already documented and applied by nine family codegen scripts ("bake the caret policy now so `workspace:*` is normalized to `workspace:^`"). It was simply never applied to the leaves whose codegen does not write `package.json`. The Svelte leaves were already fully aligned; the Vue leaves were aligned apart from three. This brings the React, Solid, Lit, and Angular leaves in line, so all six targets now state the dependency the same way.

  The `@rozie/*` toolchain packages keep `workspace:*` deliberately — they are a changesets `fixed` group and always version in lockstep, so an exact pin is correct there.

  This release still republishes these leaves, because their published `package.json` genuinely changes. The benefit is on every release after it.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- The vendored `internal/otpWrite.ts` write model (IN-04) now early-returns `null` from `planWrite` at the degenerate `length: 0` boundary instead of computing `landed: -1` (a boundary violation of the documented `OtpWrite.landed` contract; unreachable through this component with a sane `length`, but this is an exported pure function with its own test suite). No observable runtime behavior change for a correctly-configured `Otp`; no API surface change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. All input now routes through one clamped write model (`src/internal/otpWrite.ts`, vendored through codegen): SMS-autofill, swipe, and IME-commit multi-character input is distributed across cells instead of collapsing to the last character, and the fill point is clamped to the first empty cell so a write can no longer desync from the rendered value. Emit hygiene fixed: `change` fires only on an actual value transition, and `complete` fires only on the not-full → full transition (fixes a re-fire on an in-place edit of an already-full code, and the `length: 0` `clear()` edge). Added an `onPointerUp` re-select so a pointer-placed caret still overwrites the cell on mouse input.
- `spellcheck="false"` now stays native-cased on Solid — the emitter previously wrongly mapped it to `spellCheck` (copied from React's convention) against Solid's native-lowercase JSX types, which was a typecheck error; that gap is closed in `@rozie/core@0.3.0`, so `Otp.rozie`'s `autocorrect`/`spellcheck` attributes (reverted in the prior wave when this gap was found) ship here.
- The `splitProps` skip-list correctly excludes emit-handler props (`onChange`/`onComplete`) from the root DOM fallthrough spread now — previously a consumer's handler fired twice per emit.
- Docs corrections: the emit contract, the write model, the keyboard/paste/multi-character-input rows, and the accessibility section now describe the shipped behavior. The leaf README renders a prose line instead of a headerless empty Slots table.
- No API surface change: 8 props / 2 events / a 2-verb (`focus`, `clear`) imperative handle, unchanged.
- @rozie/runtime-solid@0.2.2

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/otp` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0`/`0.1.1` on-disk numbers were never published; they are changesets ripples from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps, not release history.

  This release adds behavior-VR coverage (paste distribution, backspace navigation, arrow/Home/End movement, mask rendering, disabled state, filled-cell overwrite) as test-only hardening — no API change. The surface is unchanged: 8 props / 2 events / a 2-verb (`focus`, `clear`) imperative handle.

  The `@rozie/runtime-solid` dependency now resolves to `0.2.2` (array-form `:style` merge).
