# @rozie-ui/select-lit

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- a46443a: Lit: a component that is removed from the page and added back works again. Its mount code (`$onMount`) runs again after a real teardown, as on the other targets, so listeners, observers and engine instances are set up again instead of staying torn down. Moving an element within the same task (remove and re-append before it has torn down) keeps the running instance, as before. Mount code and top-level script statements that run again see the element's retained property values.

  Lit: a prop typed with a `<types>` alias made only of string literals (or only of number literals) is now a plain reflected attribute, so `<my-el mode="compact">` works in HTML. It used to be an `Object` property whose attribute value was parsed as JSON, which failed and left the prop `null`.

  Lit: a plain-HTML or Lit consumer (not compiled by Rozie) can fill ANY slot that passes params through the element's `rozieSlots` property, keyed by the slot name (`default` for the default slot): ``el.rozieSlots = { default: ({ item }) => html`<span>${item.label}</span>` }``. The record was only read for dynamically named slots and names that are not identifiers, so an entry for an ordinary scoped slot was silently ignored. It is now tried first for every scoped slot (portal slots excepted), and a component's `$slots.<name>` check counts a record fill as filled, so content gated by `r-if="$slots.<name>"` (for example command-palette's `icon` / `actions` / `trailing` row slots) renders for a record-only fill. A Rozie consumer's fill and the native `<slot>` fallback work as before.

  Changed — Lit: a component's events no longer bubble or cross shadow roots, as on the other targets. `$emit('name', payload)` now dispatches `new CustomEvent('name', { detail: payload, bubbles: false, composed: false })` on the element. A listener on the element itself (`@name=${…}` in a Lit template, `el.addEventListener('name', …)`, a Rozie consumer's `@name`) works as before. A listener on an ancestor element, or outside the shadow root the element sits in, no longer hears it: listen on the element itself. This also means an outer `@rozie-ui/sortable-list` no longer hears the `start` / `add` / `remove` / `reorder` / `end` events of a list nested inside its rows, so the `e.composedPath()[0]` check is no longer needed. Model `*-change` events already behaved this way.

  Lit: a wrapper that forwards `r-on="$listeners"` to a child Rozie component re-dispatches the child's events on its host for the event types its consumer listens for (`@name=${…}`, `addEventListener`), and keeps doing so after the wrapper is moved in the DOM. More generally, an `r-on` listener object re-attaches as soon as its element reconnects, instead of at the element's next render. Listeners added before the component was defined are not seen (the DOM cannot list them); see Cross-Framework Parity.

  Lit: a component whose first render ran after it had already been removed from the page no longer runs its mount code (`$onMount`, document listeners) while detached, where nothing would tear it down; it mounts when it is added back.

  The `@rozie-ui/*-lit` packages listed here are rebuilt with one or more of these fixes; none of them has a string-union prop.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c4b293: README fixes: Angular examples use the component's `<rozie-select>` selector (the PascalCase tag they showed fails to compile with NG8001); the Svelte theming import is shown as a TypeScript snippet.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cf49212: Regenerated with the compiler fixes found while building `@rozie-ui/select`. Depending on the target and the component:
  - Angular: a two-way (`model: true`) prop is now controlled while the consumer binds a value — a write by the component only emits `<name>Change`, so a consumer that refuses the change keeps the control on its value. The prop keeps its `ModelSignal` type. `$onUpdate` hooks now run (after every render); they never ran before. An output named like a native bubbling event (`change`, `submit`, `reset`, `select`) no longer also delivers the native event to a consumer's binding.
  - Vue: a two-way prop bound one-way (`:value` without `v-model`) is now controlled too: the component's write emits `update:value` and the control keeps the consumer's value.
  - React: an `$expose` verb now runs in `flushSync`, so calls made in one tick each see what the call before left; primitive script constants are plain `const`s; a body statement no longer reads a binding declared after it on the first render.
  - Svelte, Solid: a `$watch` now sees a `$data` write made in `$onMount`.
  - Lit: a `$watch` whose getter reads both props and `$data` re-runs when only the prop changes; duplicated comments in lifecycle bodies are gone.

- d20d282: New family: `@rozie-ui/select`, the simple select. It replaces `@rozie-ui/listbox` (only `listbox-solid` was ever published; it will be deprecated in favour of `select-solid` after this release).

  Compared with `listbox-solid`:
  - The component is `Select`, the element `rozie-select`, classes `.rozie-select-*`, tokens `--rozie-select-*`.
  - The popup is positioned by `@rozie-ui/popover` (a required peer): `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, `disableShift`, `block`.
  - `@tanstack/virtual-core` is now a required peer (it was optional on `listbox-solid`, but the component imports it whether or not `virtual` is set).
  - Option groups: `groups` and a `groupHeading` slot.
  - `clearable` (with `clearLabel`), and multi-select values shown as removable chips with a `chip` slot.
  - `nativePicker`: opt-in OS picker on touch devices.
  - `hideEmpty` and `selectOnTab`.
  - The `id` prop is now `idBase`.
  - Token names follow Combobox's vocabulary (for example `--rozie-select-border-color`, `--rozie-select-list-shadow`, `--rozie-select-option-active-bg`), with the same defaults.
  - The trigger is a `div[role="combobox"]` inside `.rozie-select-control` (was a `button`).
  - The `search` event is no longer part of the surface.
  - @rozie/runtime-lit@0.10.0
