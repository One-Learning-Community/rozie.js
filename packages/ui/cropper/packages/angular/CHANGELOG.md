## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 78d5b5b: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `createRozieAttrApplier` and
  `createRozieHostAttrsReader` alongside the existing `RozieSlot`,
  `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken` exports. The Angular target
  used to inline a copy of the `r-bind`/`$attrs` spread attribute applier and
  host-attribute reader (~85 lines: three `WeakMap` prev-state caches, the
  class/style merge logic, and the host-attribute fold) as a private-field
  IIFE pair in _every_ emitted component that used `r-bind` spread or read
  `$attrs` — 158 tracked emitted files, of which 23 are shipped
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaf sources across 21 leaves.

  The emitted component keeps performing both `inject(Renderer2)` /
  `inject(ElementRef)` calls itself, in the same class-field initializer
  position; it now passes the resolved instance into the runtime factory
  (`createRozieAttrApplier(inject(Renderer2))`) instead of resolving it
  internally. Neither factory ever calls `inject()` or names an Angular
  type — both accept a structural interface (`RozieAttrRenderer`,
  `RozieHostRef`) — so this package still never resolves an Angular DI token
  itself, and the peer-keyed cross-package instance-identity hazard
  (`71dff1d5`) is structurally unreachable rather than merely tested against.

  Merge semantics, applied DOM output, and evaluation order are unchanged: a
  wrapper's own static `class` survives a spread that also sets `class`; a
  dropped `class`/`style` key removes only the tokens/properties this applier
  previously applied; an applied style still lands with `!important` priority,
  winning the last-write race against Angular's own `[ngClass]`/`ɵɵstyleMap`
  re-apply.

  A component using neither `r-bind` spread nor `$attrs` carries no new
  reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` — the import gate is keyed on whether
  the emitter actually pushed the corresponding field declaration, independent
  of the two Tier-1 gates (`rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr`/`rozieToken`,
  `RozieSlot`).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First all-targets release line debut publish. `@rozie-ui/cropper-angular` graduates from "deliberately out of release scope" (vue-only dogfooding) to a verified `0.1.2` publish, aligned with `-vue`/`-react`/`-solid`/`-lit`/`-svelte`. Build/typecheck/codegen-idempotency/family-test/VR gates all pass clean for the Angular target — no emitter changes were needed. Carries `tslib` only, no `@rozie` runtime dependency.
