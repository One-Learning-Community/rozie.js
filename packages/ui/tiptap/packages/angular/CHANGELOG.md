### Patch Changes

- ba42bc2: On React, Angular, and Lit, the synthesized `$portals` closure now lives at COMPONENT scope
  (React: the hook section; Angular/Lit: a private class field) instead of being declared
  inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook body. Vue, Svelte, and Solid already did the right
  thing and are unaffected in shape (Vue/Svelte additionally now declare the closure BEFORE
  the user script, matching Solid, closing a secondary TDZ hazard for a top-level invocation).

  This closes a silent parity bug: a `<script>` top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`
  previously compiled on three targets and failed on the other three — `TS2304 Cannot find
name 'portals'` on the bundled-leaf strict typecheck, `ReferenceError: portals is not
defined` at runtime, with zero diagnostics. Three failure shapes are fixed:
  1. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, called from `$onMount`.
  2. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, with NO `$onMount` at all — previously
     the whole closure was emitted NOWHERE on React (it was attached unconditionally to the
     first mount-phase hook; no hook meant it was silently dropped).
  3. A `$portals.<name>` read from a `$watch` body — broken on all three targets, and the
     shape driving most of the corpus workarounds this closes the door on.

  React additionally synthesizes a dispose-only effect (`[]` deps) for a component that has
  portals but no mount-phase lifecycle hook at all, so portal roots still bulk-dispose on
  unmount in that shape. Angular and Lit now lower `$portals.<name>` to a `this.`-qualified
  member read (the closure is a class field, not a same-method-only `const`); the
  reactive-handle `interface ReactivePortalHandle` moved to module scope on both (a TS
  `interface` cannot live inside a class body).

  A new diagnostic, ROZ149, now flags a `$portals.<name>` reference genuinely evaluated
  during setup/render — `<script>` Program top level, a `$computed` body, a `$watch` GETTER,
  or a template binding/directive/`r-for`-iterable/interpolation — since the portal anchor
  does not exist yet at those positions on any target, even after this fix. It does NOT fire
  on an ordinary function/arrow body (the shape this fix makes correct), `$onMount` /
  `$onUnmount` / `$onUpdate` bodies, a `$watch` CALLBACK, or event handlers.

  `.rozie` authors do not need to change anything for code that already calls `$portals` from
  inside `$onMount` — a hook-scope const / class field is visible from the method that used to
  declare it, so nothing that compiled before stops compiling. Emitted output is NOT
  byte-identical for any component with a portal slot — the closure text moves and, on
  Angular/Lit, gains a `this.` qualifier — so `@rozie-ui/chartjs`, `@rozie-ui/codemirror`,
  `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar`, `@rozie-ui/maplibre`, and `@rozie-ui/rete` (the shipped leaf
  packages whose `.rozie` sources declare a portal slot) take a patch bump alongside
  `@rozie/core`.

  The workaround bridges those five packages carry to route `$portals` calls into mount scope
  (null-let bridges, a "must not be called before mount" invariant, a relocated code block)
  are now unnecessary and can be unwound at leisure as an independent, opt-in follow-up — not
  part of this change.

  **Changeset scope note.** The six `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella packages are `private: true` and the repo sets `privatePackages.version: false`, so listing them alone versions nothing. The published, consumer-installed artifacts are the per-framework pre-compiled leaves (`@rozie-ui/<family>-<target>`), and they carry no dependency on `@rozie/core` — a core bump does not cascade to them. Since this change rewrites their emitted source, they are bumped explicitly. `@rozie-ui/maplibre-*` is omitted deliberately: those leaves are in the changeset config's `ignore` list. `-solid` leaves are omitted because Solid already emitted the closure at component scope and its output is unchanged.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

- eb280c9: No API change. Internal helpers that read `$portals.<name>` now live at component scope
  instead of inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook, now that quick 260829-cd4 hoists the
  emitter-synthesized `$portals` closure to component scope on all six targets.

  This unwinds the `$portals` mount-scope workarounds in three shipped `@rozie-ui`
  components (of the five originally targeted — see the CodeMirror note below) carried
  before that emitter fix landed:
  - **`@rozie-ui/tiptap`** — `makeNodeView`/`makeNodeViewExtensions` read `$portals.nodeView`
    directly instead of taking it as an injected parameter.
  - **`@rozie-ui/rete`** (`NodeType`) — the `#body` portal-mount closure is a top-level
    function instead of a null-let bridge assigned inside `$onMount`.
  - **`@rozie-ui/chartjs`** (and its 8 per-type variants, generated from the same source) —
    `buildConfig` and its click/hover/tooltip helpers are top-level; `$onMount` now only
    captures the canvas ref, constructs the `Chart` instance, and tears it down.

  `@rozie-ui/maplibre`'s per-framework leaves are changesets-ignored (deliberately
  unpublished) even though the marker/popup/interactive-layer reconcile unwind landed and
  is included in the source diff — no leaf version bump applies.

  `@rozie-ui/rete`'s sibling `FlowCanvas` component was investigated and found
  correct-by-design (its reconcilers are rooted in a `$refs` read that must stay
  `$onMount`-scoped under ROZ123) — only its stale comment was corrected, no behavior change.

  **`@rozie-ui/codemirror` REVERTED, not shipped.** The relocation was implemented, gated
  green (build/test/typecheck), and committed, but the full Docker VR union caught a
  React-only regression it introduced: the CM6 `Compartment` instances (`themeCompartment`
  et al.) lost their `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` wrapping and became a
  per-render `new Compartment()` once `buildState` (which reads them) moved out of
  `$onMount` to a top-level `useCallback` — an emitter memoization-heuristic gap, not a
  `.rozie`-source-fixable issue (SCOPE FENCE: no emitter code changed in this quick). Two
  React `code-mirror.spec.ts` tests failed (theme-toggle class never changing; an
  extensions-toggle readOnly reconfigure never taking effect) while all five other targets
  stayed green. The commit was reverted; CodeMirror.rozie and its six leaves are unchanged
  from `main` before this quick. Recorded as a follow-up for the emitter team, not
  worked around here.

  Several stale comments across the touched files claimed `$emit` and/or `$slots` also
  forced mount scope. Neither ever did, on any target — those comments are corrected too.

  No emitter code changed in this patch. `@rozie/core` is not bumped.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

- 6943820: Lit and Angular dropped every leading comment on a top-level declaration promoted into
  the component class — 1370 apiece across the shipped corpus. Both emitters build each
  class member as a hand-built string (`generate(decl)` / `renderExpression` / a rebuilt
  arrow or `t.classMethod`), and none of those carries the STATEMENT's own comments, so an
  author's documentation simply vanished from the emitted component.

  Both now run a printed-comment ledger keyed on comment OBJECT IDENTITY. Identity rather
  than source offsets is load-bearing: a `.rzts` script partial is parsed as its own file,
  so its comment offsets collide with unrelated host comments. A per-branch rule cannot
  work here at all, because @babel/parser attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements
  to BOTH neighbours at once — whichever side a local rule picks, the other side either
  double-prints it or drops it.

  Three properties this needed, each found by measuring the corpus rather than by reading
  code:

  **It looks back, not just down.** Each statement claims the PREVIOUS statement's
  still-unclaimed trailing comments as well as its own leading ones, rendering both above
  its member. Inline, one parse hands the same comment object to both sides, so it prints
  once. Across a `.rzts` splice boundary the successor comes from a different parse with
  nothing attached, and the previous statement's trailing side is the only place the
  comment exists. Without this the inline host printed a comment the partial-inlined host
  could not, and the partial-vs-inline byte-identity guards went red.

  **The ledger spans the import block.** A comment between the last import and the first
  promoted declaration is printed by the module-scope import generation — a separate
  printer with its own dedup set. Unseeded, 132 comments printed twice on Lit and 155 on
  Angular. Seeding from every comment merely ATTACHED to an import node over-corrected and
  lost 16, since a comment can hang off a node the block never prints; the seed is taken
  from what the block actually emitted.

  **It unclaims.** A statement can be consumed by another pass — a `$computed`, a lifecycle
  hook, a `$provide` directive — and produce no class member at all. When the flush finds
  no target it releases the claim so whichever printer does emit that statement still
  renders its comments. Claiming without emitting is how a ledger silently drops comments,
  which is strictly worse than double-printing, and this is why both targets report zero
  lost despite several statement kinds never reaching a ledger-owned array.

  Net effect: 5311 comments restored across 53 Lit leaves and 5266 across the Angular
  leaves, with ZERO comments dropped and ZERO non-comment bytes changed, plus 16
  pre-existing double-prints fixed on each target (a comment that had been emitted both at
  module scope and again inside the mount hook). Verified by parsing every file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides — never by reading the diff.

  Emitted code is unchanged in every case; this is documentation fidelity only.

  Eighteen further Lit/Angular leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are
  deliberately absent from the front matter — dialog, lexical, listbox, maplibre,
  number-field, pagination, resizable, slider and switch (both targets) are all in
  `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and listing an ignored package beside a
  non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- f3266db: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken`
  alongside the existing `RozieSlot` marker directive. The Angular target used to
  inline a copy of these three helpers (and, for `rozieToken`, its
  `globalThis`-backed cross-package registry) as module-scope declarations in
  _every_ emitted component that wrapped an interpolation or used the
  `$provide`/`$inject` context primitive — duplicating the same ~40 lines across 21
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaves. The emitter now imports the helpers from
  `@rozie/runtime-angular` instead.

  Behavior is unchanged: the delegating `rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr` class methods
  Angular templates call are untouched, `rozieToken`'s `globalThis`-backed identity
  guarantee is preserved verbatim, and a component using none of the three continues
  to carry no reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` at all. `number-field` and `otp`
  (previously the only two Angular leaves with no existing `@rozie/runtime-angular`
  dependency) now declare it in both `package.json` and `ng-package.json`'s
  `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- TipTap 0.3.0 — new imperative link-editor verbs plus four bubble-menu link-editor bug fixes, no breaking changes:
  - **New `setLink(attrs)` / `unsetLink()` imperative-handle verbs.** Thin delegates over the exact same `applyLink` / `removeLink` the `#linkEditor` slot scope already hands a consumer fragment, so the imperative handle and the slot-scope verb can never disagree. The handle is now 25 verbs.
  - **Fix: mount-time prefill.** The built-in link form now seeds its input from the live editor's link attributes at mount, so a document whose caret starts inside a link shows a prefilled URL instead of an empty field.
  - **Fix: open/close silently no-op'd on all six targets whenever the editor already had focus** — the common case, since the create/close controls are `@mousedown.prevent`-guarded precisely so pressing them does not collapse the selection. TipTap's `focus` command dispatches nothing when the view is already focused, and `@tiptap/extension-bubble-menu`'s `update()` short-circuits when neither the doc nor the selection changed, so `shouldShow` never re-ran either. Now routed through the extension's own documented escape hatch, `view.dispatch(state.tr.setMeta(pluginKey, 'show' | 'hide'))`.
  - **Fix: stale read on the reactive-refresh path.** The link scope was read in the same synchronous tick it was written — React's setState-is-async trap. The scope builder now takes `href` / `attrs` as parameters populated from the caller's freshly-computed locals. Consumer-visible effect: the `#linkEditor` slot scope's `href` / `attrs` now reflect the current link on every caret move rather than the previous one.
  - Internal, stated because it is why the React leaf's emitted body moved: the component's `link` data key was renamed to `linkState` because it collided with React's auto-generated `setLink` state setter once `setLink` became a public verb. No public surface change.
  - **Solid specifically:** before `@rozie/core@0.5.1`, the `#linkEditor` override slot's `setLink` / `unsetLink` / `close` threw a `ReferenceError` on Solid. The regenerated leaf here carries the emitter fix; Solid and Svelte 5 are now durably covered for this path for the first time.

  No breaking changes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b9b4351: TipTap 0.2.0 — three additive feature waves, no breaking changes:
  - **Bubble-menu link editor (#2).** A batteries-included link editor on its own selection-anchored bubble-menu surface: a toolbar **Link** button + auto-surface when the cursor is on a link, a built-in URL form (Apply / Remove / Cancel; Enter applies, Escape cancels), and a reactive `#linkEditor` override slot (`{ editor, href, attrs, setLink, unsetLink, close }`) for bring-your-own link UI. Adds the `bubbleMenuShouldShow` prop to make the general `bubbleMenu` slot's trigger consumer-controllable, the `openLinkEditor()` imperative verb, and `--rozie-tiptap-link-*` theming tokens. Custom link attributes (e.g. `data-course-link`) persist via a consumer `Link.extend({ addAttributes })` through `:extensions`.
  - **Character/word count (#1).** Optional `maxLength` renders a live `characters / maxLength` counter (overridable via the `#count` slot) with an `over` state; `enforceMaxLength` opts into a hard cap. New `getCharacterCount()` / `getWordCount()` handle verbs. Zero overhead when unused.
  - **Themeable styles (#3).** Every visual value is now a `var(--rozie-tiptap-*, <default>)` CSS custom property, so the editor chrome is themeable on install without forking — headless-UI convention, byte-identical default render.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- TipTap: configurable StarterKit, custom node registration, a richer default toolbar, and image upload.
  - **Configurable StarterKit** — new `starterKit` prop is passed straight to `StarterKit.configure(...)`, so you can disable or tune any bundled extension: `:starter-kit="{ heading: false }"`, `{ heading: { levels: [1, 2] } }`, `{ link: false }`, and so on. Supplying your own extension via `extensions` whose name matches a StarterKit-bundled node or mark (e.g. a custom `Link`) now automatically disables the built-in one — no more `Duplicate extension names found` warning, and your extension wins. (The `extensions` "consumer wins" behavior is now actually delivered; previously it was documented but did not work.)
  - **Custom node views** — new `nodeSpecs` prop lets you register your own ProseMirror nodes (`{ name, tag, group, inline, atom, content, attrs }`), rendered through the `nodeView` slot by dispatching on `node.type.name`. Note: the previously built-in `rozieMention` / `rozieCallout` demo nodes have been removed from the component — a stock `<TipTap>` no longer registers them. If you relied on them, declare them via `nodeSpecs` (see the example recipes).
  - **Richer default toolbar** — added Underline, Ordered List, Undo, and Redo buttons (all StarterKit-native; no new engine dependencies).
  - **Image upload** — new `uploadImage` prop, `(file: File) => Promise<string>`. When provided, pasted or dropped images are uploaded through your callback and inserted at the caret; when omitted, there is zero overhead. Requires `@tiptap/extension-image` (now declared as an optional peer dependency and externalized from the bundle).
