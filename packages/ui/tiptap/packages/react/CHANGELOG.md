### Patch Changes

- 843ab40: On React, a top-level `.rozie` `<script>` object or array literal const that reads nothing
  reactive (`$props`, `$data`, a computed, or a helper) is now constructed ONCE per component
  instance, matching Vue/Svelte/Angular/Lit/Solid — instead of being rebuilt with a fresh reference
  on every render.

  Before this release, only two narrow shapes were stabilized on React: a member-mutated fresh
  instance (`new X()` / `[...]` / `{...}` later mutated via `.push`/`.add`/etc.) and a const escaping
  into an effect's dependency array. A plain object/array literal outside both shapes — the common
  "engine options" / "plugin list" pattern — silently kept a fresh identity every render, so any
  `$watch` a child component ran on that prop re-fired on every unrelated parent re-render.

  `.rozie` authors do not need to change anything — this is a compiler-side fix. A literal that reads
  anything reactive, or cites a non-stable top-level reference (a helper, a plain `let`, another
  un-stabilized const), is left byte-identical to before: only a literal PROVABLY safe to build once
  gets the new `useMemo(..., [])` wrap.

  No other `@rozie-ui/*-react` leaf package changes: across the full shipped component surface, only
  `@rozie-ui/maplibre-react`'s `PROGRAMMATIC` and `@rozie-ui/tiptap-react`'s
  `STARTERKIT_COLLISION_MAP` qualify for the new stabilization.

  **Changeset scope note.** `@rozie-ui/maplibre-react` was removed from this changeset: it is in the changeset config's `ignore` list, and changesets rejects a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), which made `changeset status` — and any release run — fail outright. The maplibre leaves are deliberately unpublished, so nothing consumer-facing is lost by the removal.

- ba42bc2: On React, Angular, and Lit, the synthesized `$portals` closure now lives at COMPONENT scope
  (React: the hook section; Angular/Lit: a private class field) instead of being declared
  inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook body. Vue, Svelte, and Solid already did the right
  thing and are unaffected in shape (Vue/Svelte additionally now declare the closure BEFORE
  the user script, matching Solid, closing a secondary TDZ hazard for a top-level invocation).

  This closes a silent parity bug: a `<script>` top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`
  previously compiled on three targets and failed on the other three — `TS2304 Cannot find
name 'portals'` on the bundled-leaf strict typecheck, `ReferenceError: portals is not
defined` at runtime, with zero diagnostics. Three failure shapes are fixed:
  1. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, called from `$onMount`.
  2. A top-level helper reading `$portals.<name>`, with NO `$onMount` at all — previously
     the whole closure was emitted NOWHERE on React (it was attached unconditionally to the
     first mount-phase hook; no hook meant it was silently dropped).
  3. A `$portals.<name>` read from a `$watch` body — broken on all three targets, and the
     shape driving most of the corpus workarounds this closes the door on.

  React additionally synthesizes a dispose-only effect (`[]` deps) for a component that has
  portals but no mount-phase lifecycle hook at all, so portal roots still bulk-dispose on
  unmount in that shape. Angular and Lit now lower `$portals.<name>` to a `this.`-qualified
  member read (the closure is a class field, not a same-method-only `const`); the
  reactive-handle `interface ReactivePortalHandle` moved to module scope on both (a TS
  `interface` cannot live inside a class body).

  A new diagnostic, ROZ149, now flags a `$portals.<name>` reference genuinely evaluated
  during setup/render — `<script>` Program top level, a `$computed` body, a `$watch` GETTER,
  or a template binding/directive/`r-for`-iterable/interpolation — since the portal anchor
  does not exist yet at those positions on any target, even after this fix. It does NOT fire
  on an ordinary function/arrow body (the shape this fix makes correct), `$onMount` /
  `$onUnmount` / `$onUpdate` bodies, a `$watch` CALLBACK, or event handlers.

  `.rozie` authors do not need to change anything for code that already calls `$portals` from
  inside `$onMount` — a hook-scope const / class field is visible from the method that used to
  declare it, so nothing that compiled before stops compiling. Emitted output is NOT
  byte-identical for any component with a portal slot — the closure text moves and, on
  Angular/Lit, gains a `this.` qualifier — so `@rozie-ui/chartjs`, `@rozie-ui/codemirror`,
  `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar`, `@rozie-ui/maplibre`, and `@rozie-ui/rete` (the shipped leaf
  packages whose `.rozie` sources declare a portal slot) take a patch bump alongside
  `@rozie/core`.

  The workaround bridges those five packages carry to route `$portals` calls into mount scope
  (null-let bridges, a "must not be called before mount" invariant, a relocated code block)
  are now unnecessary and can be unwound at leisure as an independent, opt-in follow-up — not
  part of this change.

  **Changeset scope note.** The six `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella packages are `private: true` and the repo sets `privatePackages.version: false`, so listing them alone versions nothing. The published, consumer-installed artifacts are the per-framework pre-compiled leaves (`@rozie-ui/<family>-<target>`), and they carry no dependency on `@rozie/core` — a core bump does not cascade to them. Since this change rewrites their emitted source, they are bumped explicitly. `@rozie-ui/maplibre-*` is omitted deliberately: those leaves are in the changeset config's `ignore` list. `-solid` leaves are omitted because Solid already emitted the closure at component scope and its output is unchanged.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

- eb280c9: No API change. Internal helpers that read `$portals.<name>` now live at component scope
  instead of inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook, now that quick 260829-cd4 hoists the
  emitter-synthesized `$portals` closure to component scope on all six targets.

  This unwinds the `$portals` mount-scope workarounds in three shipped `@rozie-ui`
  components (of the five originally targeted — see the CodeMirror note below) carried
  before that emitter fix landed:
  - **`@rozie-ui/tiptap`** — `makeNodeView`/`makeNodeViewExtensions` read `$portals.nodeView`
    directly instead of taking it as an injected parameter.
  - **`@rozie-ui/rete`** (`NodeType`) — the `#body` portal-mount closure is a top-level
    function instead of a null-let bridge assigned inside `$onMount`.
  - **`@rozie-ui/chartjs`** (and its 8 per-type variants, generated from the same source) —
    `buildConfig` and its click/hover/tooltip helpers are top-level; `$onMount` now only
    captures the canvas ref, constructs the `Chart` instance, and tears it down.

  `@rozie-ui/maplibre`'s per-framework leaves are changesets-ignored (deliberately
  unpublished) even though the marker/popup/interactive-layer reconcile unwind landed and
  is included in the source diff — no leaf version bump applies.

  `@rozie-ui/rete`'s sibling `FlowCanvas` component was investigated and found
  correct-by-design (its reconcilers are rooted in a `$refs` read that must stay
  `$onMount`-scoped under ROZ123) — only its stale comment was corrected, no behavior change.

  **`@rozie-ui/codemirror` REVERTED, not shipped.** The relocation was implemented, gated
  green (build/test/typecheck), and committed, but the full Docker VR union caught a
  React-only regression it introduced: the CM6 `Compartment` instances (`themeCompartment`
  et al.) lost their `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` wrapping and became a
  per-render `new Compartment()` once `buildState` (which reads them) moved out of
  `$onMount` to a top-level `useCallback` — an emitter memoization-heuristic gap, not a
  `.rozie`-source-fixable issue (SCOPE FENCE: no emitter code changed in this quick). Two
  React `code-mirror.spec.ts` tests failed (theme-toggle class never changing; an
  extensions-toggle readOnly reconfigure never taking effect) while all five other targets
  stayed green. The commit was reverted; CodeMirror.rozie and its six leaves are unchanged
  from `main` before this quick. Recorded as a follow-up for the emitter team, not
  worked around here.

  Several stale comments across the touched files claimed `$emit` and/or `$slots` also
  forced mount scope. Neither ever did, on any target — those comments are corrected too.

  No emitter code changed in this patch. `@rozie/core` is not bumped.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

- 6274a5f: React's `useMemo` stabilization of an escaping top-level `const` was discovered by a
  ONE-LEVEL, NON-TRANSITIVE scan of `Listener.deps` / `LifecycleHook.setupDeps` — a
  `new X()` an effect reached only THROUGH a top-level helper (`buildState() ->
gutterCompartment.of(...)`) was invisible to that scan and never got `useMemo`, so React
  rebuilt it fresh every render. For an identity-keyed engine object (a CodeMirror6
  `Compartment`, a Map/WeakMap/Set used as cross-render scratch state) this silently no-ops
  any imperative API keyed on that instance's identity — CodeMirror's
  `scheduleReconfigure(compartment, ...)` against an `EditorState` that never saw the fresh
  Compartment being the corpus shape that surfaced this. All four turbo gates (build, test,
  dist-parity, typecheck) stayed green while the bug was live; only visual regression testing
  caught it.

  `computeEscapingNames` (`packages/targets/react/src/emit/computeEscapingNames.ts`) now runs
  a worklist-to-fixpoint over top-level helper bodies: a helper name reached by an
  effect/listener seed is walked (its body inspected for further references) but never itself
  promoted into the escaping set — only a non-function top-level `const` binder reached at any
  depth through that walk is added. This bound is deliberate: promoting a helper NAME into the
  escaping set would flip a hoisted `function` declaration back into a non-hoisted
  `useCallback` const, reopening the temporal-dead-zone class the emitter's plain-hoist branch
  exists to close, across 860+ shipped `function` declarations corpus-wide. The duplicated seed
  computation (previously maintained independently in two places in `emitScript.ts`) is now
  one shared computation, so the `useMemo`/`useCallback` wrap decision and the seam-3 staleness
  classification can never silently diverge.

  The CodeMirror unwind quick 260829-gbs had to revert (`5d48f9156`, because the two
  `code-mirror [react]` VR cells failed all retries under the pre-fix emitter) is re-landed:
  all six leaves regenerated from the fixed emitter, all ten CM6 `Compartment` instances now
  emit as `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` on React, and the five non-React leaves are
  byte-identical to the original unwind (`61bf99340`) — the emitter fix itself is React-only.

  Four other shipped React leaves carried a const of this exact shape and changed wrap form as
  an expected consequence, each individually inspected (correct empty dep array on a
  non-reactive initializer, no reactive-read case regressed to `[]`, no `.current`-read freeze
  hazard, and zero helper `function` declarations flipped form anywhere in the corpus):
  `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` (`GRID_PAGE_STEP`, `DATA_WRITE_TOKEN_KEY`, `SELECT_COL_ID`,
  `EXPANDER_COL_ID`), `@rozie-ui/rete-react` (`RESIZE_MIN_FALLBACK`, `CONN_WARN_SETTLE_MS`,
  `HISTORY_CAP`, `ZOOM_STEP`), and `@rozie-ui/toast-react` (`EXIT_FAILSAFE_MS`). Every one is a
  bare literal initializer reading nothing, so `[]` is the correct and complete dep array.

  **Emitted-comment fidelity — two structural fixes.** The component-scope emission loop mixes
  statements emitted as hand-built STRINGS (four `tryWrap*` passes) with statements emitted
  through a per-statement `@babel/generator` call, each of the latter carrying its own
  printed-comment dedup set. Because Babel attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements to
  BOTH neighbours at once, a shared comment printed TWICE (both neighbours rendered it) or ZERO
  times (neither did), depending purely on which pass claimed each side — and both failures
  were live in the shipped corpus simultaneously. No per-wrap rule can be right for both sides,
  so the decision moved to a block-wide printed-comment ledger keyed on comment object
  identity, which prints every comment exactly once in source order regardless of which pass
  claims either neighbour. This mirrors the single-dedup-set precedent `genBlockInner` and
  `genImportsBlock` already set for their own scopes.

  Separately, `hoistModuleLet` removed a hoisted `let`'s declaration from the component body
  and took the author's comment on that declaration with it. Those leading comments are now
  re-homed onto the nearest surviving neighbour before removal. This one was invisible from
  inside a single component: an inline host kept such a comment (its neighbour is one parse
  away and carries it as `trailingComments`) while the byte-identical `<script src>`
  partial-inlined host — whose spliced node comes from a DIFFERENT parse with no comments
  attached — lost it. `dist-parity`'s Phase 56-R8 / R11 partial-vs-inline byte-identity cells
  are what caught it.

  Net effect across the shipped React corpus: 2110 comment lines restored, 187 duplicate
  prints removed, and **zero** comments dropped and **zero** non-comment bytes changed —
  verified line-by-line against the pre-change corpus. Fifteen further React leaves are bumped
  here for that comment-fidelity restoration alone, with no code change:
  `@rozie-ui/captcha-react`, `chartjs-react`, `combobox-react`, `command-palette-react`,
  `cropper-react`, `date-picker-react`, `embla-react`, `flatpickr-react`, `otp-react`,
  `pdf-react`, `popover-react`, `sortable-list-react`, `tags-react`, `tiptap-react`, and
  `wavesurfer-react`.

  Nine more React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately OMITTED from
  the front matter: `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package alongside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail
  outright — the exact breakage `8865e96df` repaired, not reintroduced here.

- 4a2de54: React dropped the author's leading comments on any top-level `const f = () => {…}`. The
  emitter rebuilds those as `function f() {…}` so the binding hoists (a real TDZ fix), but it
  returned the bare synthetic node — no source position and no comments attached — so
  `@babel/generator` printed the declaration and silently discarded everything documenting it.
  Measured against the shipped corpus, that was 683 of React's 899 lost comments; Solid, whose
  identically-named `tryHoistArrowToFunction` has always ended with `t.inherits(fn, stmt)`,
  lost none. React simply never got that line.

  Restoring it alone is only half the mechanism, and the half on its own is a regression. A
  comment authored between a hoisted module-`let` and the declaration below it survives on the
  inline path (one parse attaches the comment object to both neighbours, so the successor still
  carries it) but not across a `<script src>` partial boundary, where the spliced successor
  comes from a different parse with nothing attached. There the comment lives only on the
  removed `let`'s trailing side and dies with the statement — so the inline host printed a
  comment the partial-inlined host could not, and the two stopped being byte-identical.

  Quick task 260829-j18 re-homed a removed statement's LEADING comments onto a surviving
  neighbour but deliberately skipped the trailing side, on the reasoning that a removed
  statement's trailing comments are the same objects Babel attached as the next statement's
  leading comments, so that side already had an owner. That holds for an inline-authored
  `<script>` and fails at a splice boundary. `hoistModuleLet` now re-homes the trailing side
  too, onto the nearest following survivor, deduped by comment object IDENTITY — which is what
  keeps the inline case from double-printing, since there the object is already present on the
  successor.

  The two changes ship together and are asserted together: `dist-parity`'s multi-boundary
  "DataTable-shaped permanent guard" goes red with either half missing, and green with both.

  Across the 38 regenerated React leaves this restores **2655 comments, with zero comments
  dropped and zero non-comment bytes changed** — verified by parsing each file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides, rather than by reading the diff. The
  dist-parity fixture rebless was verified the same way (55 comments restored, no code delta).

  One cosmetic wart, not fixed here: in `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` a single restored comment
  prints on the same line as the preceding function's closing brace (`} // …`) instead of
  starting its own line, because it is re-homed as the previous statement's trailing comment.
  The block still reads immediately above the declaration it documents and the AST is
  unaffected. Output prettiness stays a v2 concern.

  Nine further React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately absent from
  the front matter — `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package beside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- TipTap 0.3.0 — new imperative link-editor verbs plus four bubble-menu link-editor bug fixes, no breaking changes:
  - **New `setLink(attrs)` / `unsetLink()` imperative-handle verbs.** Thin delegates over the exact same `applyLink` / `removeLink` the `#linkEditor` slot scope already hands a consumer fragment, so the imperative handle and the slot-scope verb can never disagree. The handle is now 25 verbs.
  - **Fix: mount-time prefill.** The built-in link form now seeds its input from the live editor's link attributes at mount, so a document whose caret starts inside a link shows a prefilled URL instead of an empty field.
  - **Fix: open/close silently no-op'd on all six targets whenever the editor already had focus** — the common case, since the create/close controls are `@mousedown.prevent`-guarded precisely so pressing them does not collapse the selection. TipTap's `focus` command dispatches nothing when the view is already focused, and `@tiptap/extension-bubble-menu`'s `update()` short-circuits when neither the doc nor the selection changed, so `shouldShow` never re-ran either. Now routed through the extension's own documented escape hatch, `view.dispatch(state.tr.setMeta(pluginKey, 'show' | 'hide'))`.
  - **Fix: stale read on the reactive-refresh path.** The link scope was read in the same synchronous tick it was written — React's setState-is-async trap. The scope builder now takes `href` / `attrs` as parameters populated from the caller's freshly-computed locals. Consumer-visible effect: the `#linkEditor` slot scope's `href` / `attrs` now reflect the current link on every caret move rather than the previous one.
  - Internal, stated because it is why the React leaf's emitted body moved: the component's `link` data key was renamed to `linkState` because it collided with React's auto-generated `setLink` state setter once `setLink` became a public verb. No public surface change.
  - **Solid specifically:** before `@rozie/core@0.5.1`, the `#linkEditor` override slot's `setLink` / `unsetLink` / `close` threw a `ReferenceError` on Solid. The regenerated leaf here carries the emitter fix; Solid and Svelte 5 are now durably covered for this path for the first time.

  No breaking changes.

### Patch Changes

- Stale-publish reconciliation. The published `0.2.2` tarball predates commit `1b0e5254`'s value-position stale-closure fix and never carried it — `pnpm publish` silently skips an already-published version, so the registry has been serving the pre-fix bytes at `0.2.2` since 2026-08-06.
  - **Fix: `uploadImage` paste/drop handlers could keep calling a stale upload function after mount.** `0.2.2` already ref-mirrored _whether_ the image-upload hook is registered at all, evaluated fresh at the editor's construction. This release hardens the layer beneath that: `handlePaste`/`handleDrop` themselves are now ref-indirected, so if a consumer swaps to a new `uploadImage` function identity after mount (without ever passing `null`), a subsequent paste or drop now invokes that current function instead of continuing to call the one captured at construction time.
  - No prop / event / slot / handle surface change.

- Updated dependencies
  - @rozie/runtime-react@0.5.1

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Mount-time staleness fix. Values read inside `$onMount` are now mirrored through synced refs, so a callback registered once at mount no longer reads the first render's values for the lifetime of the component. A consumer that changes a prop — or passes a new handler identity — after mount is now observed by the mount-registered callback instead of being silently ignored.

  All three read kinds landed here, across 20 synced refs:
  - **Prop reads** (12) — `ariaLabel`, `autofocus`, `bubbleMenuShouldShow`, `editorClass`, `editorProps`, `enforceMaxLength`, `extensions`, `maxLength`, `nodeSpecs`, `placeholder`, `starterKit`, `uploadImage`. The TipTap editor is constructed inside `$onMount`; these now read their current values at construction time rather than the first render's. `enforceMaxLength`/`maxLength` and `uploadImage` are the consumer-visible ones — a length cap or upload handler changed after mount is now honored.
  - **Helper calls** (4) — `buildDefaultLinkEditor`, `buildLinkScope`, `makeNodeViewExtensions`, `refreshLink`, so the bubble-menu link editor and node views operate on current state.
  - **`$emit` handler props** (4) — `onBlur`, `onFocus`, `onSelectionUpdate`, `onUpdate`. TipTap's event handlers are bound to the editor instance once at construction, so a consumer that swapped `onUpdate` after mount previously kept the original closure being called on every keystroke.

- No API surface change.
- @rozie/runtime-react@0.2.3

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. The public `.d.ts` no longer types unresolved `r-for` slot-context params as callable (`() => void`) — they're now `unknown`, matching what the runtime actually hands the caller. No API surface change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b9b4351: TipTap 0.2.0 — three additive feature waves, no breaking changes:
  - **Bubble-menu link editor (#2).** A batteries-included link editor on its own selection-anchored bubble-menu surface: a toolbar **Link** button + auto-surface when the cursor is on a link, a built-in URL form (Apply / Remove / Cancel; Enter applies, Escape cancels), and a reactive `#linkEditor` override slot (`{ editor, href, attrs, setLink, unsetLink, close }`) for bring-your-own link UI. Adds the `bubbleMenuShouldShow` prop to make the general `bubbleMenu` slot's trigger consumer-controllable, the `openLinkEditor()` imperative verb, and `--rozie-tiptap-link-*` theming tokens. Custom link attributes (e.g. `data-course-link`) persist via a consumer `Link.extend({ addAttributes })` through `:extensions`.
  - **Character/word count (#1).** Optional `maxLength` renders a live `characters / maxLength` counter (overridable via the `#count` slot) with an `over` state; `enforceMaxLength` opts into a hard cap. New `getCharacterCount()` / `getWordCount()` handle verbs. Zero overhead when unused.
  - **Themeable styles (#3).** Every visual value is now a `var(--rozie-tiptap-*, <default>)` CSS custom property, so the editor chrome is themeable on install without forking — headless-UI convention, byte-identical default render.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- TipTap: configurable StarterKit, custom node registration, a richer default toolbar, and image upload.
  - **Configurable StarterKit** — new `starterKit` prop is passed straight to `StarterKit.configure(...)`, so you can disable or tune any bundled extension: `:starter-kit="{ heading: false }"`, `{ heading: { levels: [1, 2] } }`, `{ link: false }`, and so on. Supplying your own extension via `extensions` whose name matches a StarterKit-bundled node or mark (e.g. a custom `Link`) now automatically disables the built-in one — no more `Duplicate extension names found` warning, and your extension wins. (The `extensions` "consumer wins" behavior is now actually delivered; previously it was documented but did not work.)
  - **Custom node views** — new `nodeSpecs` prop lets you register your own ProseMirror nodes (`{ name, tag, group, inline, atom, content, attrs }`), rendered through the `nodeView` slot by dispatching on `node.type.name`. Note: the previously built-in `rozieMention` / `rozieCallout` demo nodes have been removed from the component — a stock `<TipTap>` no longer registers them. If you relied on them, declare them via `nodeSpecs` (see the example recipes).
  - **Richer default toolbar** — added Underline, Ordered List, Undo, and Redo buttons (all StarterKit-native; no new engine dependencies).
  - **Image upload** — new `uploadImage` prop, `(file: File) => Promise<string>`. When provided, pasted or dropped images are uploaded through your callback and inserted at the caret; when omitted, there is zero overhead. Requires `@tiptap/extension-image` (now declared as an optional peer dependency and externalized from the bundle).
