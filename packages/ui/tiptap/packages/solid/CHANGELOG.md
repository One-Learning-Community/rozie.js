## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f2148d: Two findings from dogfooding, both consumer-visible on install and on construction timing.

  **BREAKING — `@tiptap/extension-bubble-menu` is now a required peer dependency, not
  optional.** The built-in link editor is a `BubbleMenu` on every editor, unconditionally, so
  declaring it optional was never accurate — a consumer who never installed it simply never
  noticed until they hit the link-editor path. If you don't already have it installed:

  ```
  npm install @tiptap/extension-bubble-menu
  ```

  **`character-count`, `image`, and `floating-menu` extension peers are now lazy-loaded, only
  when their feature is actually used**, instead of being statically imported by every leaf
  regardless of whether the consumer installed them. `@tiptap/extension-character-count` loads
  only when `maxLength` (or the `#count` slot) is used; `@tiptap/extension-image` only when
  `uploadImage` is used; `@tiptap/extension-floating-menu` only when the `floatingMenu` slot is
  used. Declaring these peers `peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true` is now actually true — you may
  drop whichever of the three you don't use.

  **New event: `ready`.** Fired once per mount, on both the synchronous and the (new) lazy
  construction path, with the live `Editor` instance as its payload. **If your component uses
  `maxLength`, `uploadImage`, or a `floatingMenu` slot, construction is now asynchronous** — use
  `ready` (`onReady` / `@ready`) to know when calling a handle verb like `focusEditor()` will
  actually work, rather than an arbitrary delay. With none of the three lazy features in use, the
  editor is still constructed synchronously at mount, exactly as before. `ready`'s payload is typed
  `unknown`, matching every other emitted event today.

  **`tiptap-vue` — Vue's `inherit-attrs`/`inherit-listeners` opt-out now applies** (see the
  `@rozie/core` changeset in this same release for the underlying emitter fix): undeclared
  attributes and listeners no longer fall through onto `tiptap-vue`'s wrapper element, matching the
  other five targets. This is a **behaviour change** if you were relying on that fallthrough on Vue
  specifically.

  **Solid packaging.** `@rozie-ui/tiptap-solid` ships the same compiled-JS-by-default,
  JSX-under-the-`solid`-condition packaging shape as every other published Solid leaf this release
  — see the dedicated Solid packaging changeset for the full description. No API change.

  Docs updated: the install line now lists all four required peers plus the three optional ones
  (it previously omitted `@tiptap/extensions` and `bubble-menu` and claimed both menu peers were
  optional).

### Patch Changes

- 4f2148d: **Fixed: a stale pre-unmount async construction could double-construct the Editor
  under React StrictMode** (`maxLength`/`uploadImage`/`floatingMenu` lazy-extension path
  only). React's dev-mode StrictMode double-invoke (mount → cleanup → mount, against the
  SAME component instance) could let a stale first invocation's async extension-load
  `.then()` construct a SECOND Editor onto the same DOM node and fire `ready` twice,
  because the internal `disposed` guard was reset by the second invocation before the
  first's `.then()` ever settled. Fixed with a per-mount-invocation guard; no API change.

  **Fixed: `setContent()`/`clearContent()` no longer drop a write made during the async
  construction gap** (`maxLength`/`uploadImage`/`floatingMenu` lazy-extension path only).
  Calling either before `ready` now updates the bound `html` model immediately, and the
  editor constructs with that value once it exists, instead of the write silently vanishing.

  **New event: `error`.** Fired when an optional extension (`floatingMenu`/`image`/`count`)
  fails to load via its dynamic `import()` — payload is `{ extension, error }`. Previously
  an unhandled rejection on the internal `Promise.all` left the editor permanently
  uncreated, silently, on ANY chunk-load failure (a real-world CDN/network blip). The
  editor now still constructs WITHOUT the failed extension (degrade) instead of never
  constructing at all; the failure is also reported via `console.error`.

  **Docs: the `ready` event's README table row is no longer empty.** Its description was
  missing from the generator's event-description map since `ready` shipped last release;
  now documented, alongside the new `error` event above.

- 4f2148d: **Fixed: published Solid leaves now ship compiled JavaScript for `import`/`require`, with JSX
  kept only under the `solid` export condition.**

  Every `@rozie-ui/*-solid` leaf with markup previously shipped Solid JSX inside
  `dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` under a plain `import`/`require` (`chartjs-solid` renders no markup of its
  own, but ships the same corrected export shape for consistency with its siblings). That is not
  valid JavaScript on its own — a default `vite-plugin-solid` setup
  fails with "JSX syntax is disabled" (the plugin only transforms `.[mc]?[jt]sx` files), and any
  bundler without a Solid plugin fails outright. The only way to consume these packages was to
  manually point `vite-plugin-solid` at the package's `.mjs` files inside `node_modules` — a
  workaround, not a supported shape.

  New export shape (the standard one for a published Solid library):
  - `import` / `require` → `dist/<entry>.{mjs,cjs}`, compiled to plain DOM output by
    `babel-preset-solid`. Any bundler consumes this with no Solid plugin at all.
  - `solid` (export condition) → `dist/source/<entry>.jsx`, JSX kept intact. `vite-plugin-solid`
    and SolidStart resolve this condition first and compile it themselves for their own mode (DOM /
    SSR / hydration).

  **If you were using the `extensions: ['.mjs']` / `node_modules` `include` workaround with
  `vite-plugin-solid` to consume one of these packages, remove it — it is no longer needed** and a
  default `vite-plugin-solid` setup now resolves the `solid` condition correctly on its own. No
  public API change on any of these leaves.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Solid: slot scope values are now passed as lazy getters instead of eager reads.

  A scoped slot invocation used to build its param object as `{ open: open() }`. Because that object is constructed inside the JSX insert that invokes the slot, Solid subscribed the **insert itself** to every signal read while building it — so any change re-ran the insert, re-invoked the consumer's slot function, and replaced the rendered subtree. Emitting `{ get open() { return open(); } }` defers the read into the consumer's own reactive scope, which is Solid's own convention for passing reactive props.

  Observable fix: opening the data-table column menu no longer tears the just-focused trigger out of the DOM, so the documented "Escape returns focus to the trigger" guarantee now holds on Solid as it already did on the other five targets.

  Literals and function-valued expressions are deliberately left as plain properties — neither can read a signal, and wrapping a function would hand the consumer a new identity on every property access.

  Note for consumers: destructuring a slot scope (`({ option, index }) => …`) and spreading it behave exactly as before. The one behavior change is that **assigning** to a scope property now throws `TypeError: Cannot set property x of #<Object> which has only a getter`, where it previously succeeded silently. Writing to a slot scope was never a supported pattern.

  `@rozie/core` is named here even though no file under `packages/core/` changed: the emitter lives in the private `@rozie/target-solid` package, which is bundled into core's published dist (and into `unplugin`, `babel-plugin`, and `cli`). A changeset derived from changed paths alone would ship a toolchain that still emits the bug.

### Patch Changes

- eb280c9: No API change. Internal helpers that read `$portals.<name>` now live at component scope
  instead of inside the mount-phase lifecycle hook, now that quick 260829-cd4 hoists the
  emitter-synthesized `$portals` closure to component scope on all six targets.

  This unwinds the `$portals` mount-scope workarounds in three shipped `@rozie-ui`
  components (of the five originally targeted — see the CodeMirror note below) carried
  before that emitter fix landed:
  - **`@rozie-ui/tiptap`** — `makeNodeView`/`makeNodeViewExtensions` read `$portals.nodeView`
    directly instead of taking it as an injected parameter.
  - **`@rozie-ui/rete`** (`NodeType`) — the `#body` portal-mount closure is a top-level
    function instead of a null-let bridge assigned inside `$onMount`.
  - **`@rozie-ui/chartjs`** (and its 8 per-type variants, generated from the same source) —
    `buildConfig` and its click/hover/tooltip helpers are top-level; `$onMount` now only
    captures the canvas ref, constructs the `Chart` instance, and tears it down.

  `@rozie-ui/maplibre`'s per-framework leaves are changesets-ignored (deliberately
  unpublished) even though the marker/popup/interactive-layer reconcile unwind landed and
  is included in the source diff — no leaf version bump applies.

  `@rozie-ui/rete`'s sibling `FlowCanvas` component was investigated and found
  correct-by-design (its reconcilers are rooted in a `$refs` read that must stay
  `$onMount`-scoped under ROZ123) — only its stale comment was corrected, no behavior change.

  **`@rozie-ui/codemirror` REVERTED, not shipped.** The relocation was implemented, gated
  green (build/test/typecheck), and committed, but the full Docker VR union caught a
  React-only regression it introduced: the CM6 `Compartment` instances (`themeCompartment`
  et al.) lost their `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` wrapping and became a
  per-render `new Compartment()` once `buildState` (which reads them) moved out of
  `$onMount` to a top-level `useCallback` — an emitter memoization-heuristic gap, not a
  `.rozie`-source-fixable issue (SCOPE FENCE: no emitter code changed in this quick). Two
  React `code-mirror.spec.ts` tests failed (theme-toggle class never changing; an
  extensions-toggle readOnly reconfigure never taking effect) while all five other targets
  stayed green. The commit was reverted; CodeMirror.rozie and its six leaves are unchanged
  from `main` before this quick. Recorded as a follow-up for the emitter team, not
  worked around here.

  Several stale comments across the touched files claimed `$emit` and/or `$slots` also
  forced mount scope. Neither ever did, on any target — those comments are corrected too.

  No emitter code changed in this patch. `@rozie/core` is not bumped.

  **Why no `@rozie-ui/<family>` umbrella entries.** Those six packages are `private: true`, so changesets treats them as ignored; a changeset that mixes ignored and non-ignored packages is rejected outright (`Mixed changesets that contain both ignored and not ignored packages are not allowed`), failing `changeset status` and any release run. Only the published, consumer-installed per-framework leaves are listed.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- TipTap 0.3.0 — new imperative link-editor verbs plus four bubble-menu link-editor bug fixes, no breaking changes:
  - **New `setLink(attrs)` / `unsetLink()` imperative-handle verbs.** Thin delegates over the exact same `applyLink` / `removeLink` the `#linkEditor` slot scope already hands a consumer fragment, so the imperative handle and the slot-scope verb can never disagree. The handle is now 25 verbs.
  - **Fix: mount-time prefill.** The built-in link form now seeds its input from the live editor's link attributes at mount, so a document whose caret starts inside a link shows a prefilled URL instead of an empty field.
  - **Fix: open/close silently no-op'd on all six targets whenever the editor already had focus** — the common case, since the create/close controls are `@mousedown.prevent`-guarded precisely so pressing them does not collapse the selection. TipTap's `focus` command dispatches nothing when the view is already focused, and `@tiptap/extension-bubble-menu`'s `update()` short-circuits when neither the doc nor the selection changed, so `shouldShow` never re-ran either. Now routed through the extension's own documented escape hatch, `view.dispatch(state.tr.setMeta(pluginKey, 'show' | 'hide'))`.
  - **Fix: stale read on the reactive-refresh path.** The link scope was read in the same synchronous tick it was written — React's setState-is-async trap. The scope builder now takes `href` / `attrs` as parameters populated from the caller's freshly-computed locals. Consumer-visible effect: the `#linkEditor` slot scope's `href` / `attrs` now reflect the current link on every caret move rather than the previous one.
  - Internal, stated because it is why the React leaf's emitted body moved: the component's `link` data key was renamed to `linkState` because it collided with React's auto-generated `setLink` state setter once `setLink` became a public verb. No public surface change.
  - **Solid specifically:** before `@rozie/core@0.5.1`, the `#linkEditor` override slot's `setLink` / `unsetLink` / `close` threw a `ReferenceError` on Solid. The regenerated leaf here carries the emitter fix; Solid and Svelte 5 are now durably covered for this path for the first time.

  No breaking changes.

- Updated dependencies
  - @rozie/runtime-solid@0.5.1

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. The `splitProps` skip-list now correctly excludes emit-handler props from the root DOM fallthrough spread — previously a consumer's handler fired twice per emit. No API surface change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b9b4351: TipTap 0.2.0 — three additive feature waves, no breaking changes:
  - **Bubble-menu link editor (#2).** A batteries-included link editor on its own selection-anchored bubble-menu surface: a toolbar **Link** button + auto-surface when the cursor is on a link, a built-in URL form (Apply / Remove / Cancel; Enter applies, Escape cancels), and a reactive `#linkEditor` override slot (`{ editor, href, attrs, setLink, unsetLink, close }`) for bring-your-own link UI. Adds the `bubbleMenuShouldShow` prop to make the general `bubbleMenu` slot's trigger consumer-controllable, the `openLinkEditor()` imperative verb, and `--rozie-tiptap-link-*` theming tokens. Custom link attributes (e.g. `data-course-link`) persist via a consumer `Link.extend({ addAttributes })` through `:extensions`.
  - **Character/word count (#1).** Optional `maxLength` renders a live `characters / maxLength` counter (overridable via the `#count` slot) with an `over` state; `enforceMaxLength` opts into a hard cap. New `getCharacterCount()` / `getWordCount()` handle verbs. Zero overhead when unused.
  - **Themeable styles (#3).** Every visual value is now a `var(--rozie-tiptap-*, <default>)` CSS custom property, so the editor chrome is themeable on install without forking — headless-UI convention, byte-identical default render.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- TipTap: configurable StarterKit, custom node registration, a richer default toolbar, and image upload.
  - **Configurable StarterKit** — new `starterKit` prop is passed straight to `StarterKit.configure(...)`, so you can disable or tune any bundled extension: `:starter-kit="{ heading: false }"`, `{ heading: { levels: [1, 2] } }`, `{ link: false }`, and so on. Supplying your own extension via `extensions` whose name matches a StarterKit-bundled node or mark (e.g. a custom `Link`) now automatically disables the built-in one — no more `Duplicate extension names found` warning, and your extension wins. (The `extensions` "consumer wins" behavior is now actually delivered; previously it was documented but did not work.)
  - **Custom node views** — new `nodeSpecs` prop lets you register your own ProseMirror nodes (`{ name, tag, group, inline, atom, content, attrs }`), rendered through the `nodeView` slot by dispatching on `node.type.name`. Note: the previously built-in `rozieMention` / `rozieCallout` demo nodes have been removed from the component — a stock `<TipTap>` no longer registers them. If you relied on them, declare them via `nodeSpecs` (see the example recipes).
  - **Richer default toolbar** — added Underline, Ordered List, Undo, and Redo buttons (all StarterKit-native; no new engine dependencies).
  - **Image upload** — new `uploadImage` prop, `(file: File) => Promise<string>`. When provided, pasted or dropped images are uploaded through your callback and inserted at the caret; when omitted, there is zero overhead. Requires `@tiptap/extension-image` (now declared as an optional peer dependency and externalized from the bundle).
