## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- `@rozie/runtime-lit` gains a new public export, `RozieSlotDistributor` — a reactive
  controller that performs manual slot assignment for a Lit shadow root, used wherever a
  component needs to route projected children into loop-generated `<slot>` targets
  (e.g. carousel slides). Adopting manual `slotAssignment` turns OFF the browser's
  automatic Text-node projection for that shadow root: raw text children must now be
  assigned to a slot explicitly, and any code reading `assignedNodes()` needs to guard
  for the manual-assignment case. A host that adopts the controller needs its
  `shadowRootOptions` typed as `ShadowRootInit`.

  `@rozie/core` adds two new compile-time diagnostics and one new template sigil:
  - **ROZ148** — flags a prop whose name collides with an emitted callback name, before
    it becomes a runtime shadowing bug on a target that lowers the prop to a method.
  - **ROZ210** — flags a reserved slot name so it can't silently collide with an
    internally-generated one.
  - **`$slotted`** — a new member sigil authors can read inside a loop to get the live,
    reactively-assigned elements projected into that iteration's slot.

  `@rozie/{cli,unplugin,babel-plugin}` bundle `@rozie/core`'s compiler, so this release
  carries the same diagnostics and `$slotted` lowering through to every consumer of
  those packages — the compiler itself moved even though none of these three changed
  their own source. `$slotted` lowers to a reactive assigned-elements signal on the Lit
  target (backed by `RozieSlotDistributor`, gated behind a new `shouldDistributeSlots`
  check so it only emits where a loop actually needs manual slot assignment) and to a
  plain `[]` on the five hostless targets (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular), where
  there's no shadow root to distribute into.

  `@rozie/runtime-{react,vue,svelte,solid,keynav-core}` are version-aligned to 0.5.0 by
  the changesets `fixed` group riding the `runtime-lit` minor above — this is a
  version-alignment release only; none of these five packages has a source or behavior
  change in this wave.

  `@rozie-ui/date-picker-*` (all six targets) — day and caption labels are now derived
  from `Intl`, with a new `labels` prop for overriding them; range-span selections now
  validate against `disabled` dates; and the calendar header adds drill-in/drill-out
  navigation verbs.

  `@rozie-ui/embla-*` (all six targets) adopts `$slotted` for its carousel slides. On
  the Lit target specifically, this closes a real projection gap: raw `slot="slide"`
  children are now distributed per-iteration instead of only the first iteration
  claiming them.

  `@rozie-ui/{combobox,command-palette,data-table,sortable-list,tags,toast}-lit` are
  regenerated against the new Lit emitter output above — each already used a loop-slot
  pattern that now runs through `RozieSlotDistributor` / `$slotted` instead of the prior
  ad hoc approach, with no observable behavior change for existing consumers of these
  specific leaves.

- Updated dependencies
  - @rozie/runtime-lit@0.5.0

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. `r-for` loop keys are no longer leaked as literal DOM attributes on emitted elements. No API surface change.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- c279a7e: Fix the `$attrs` auto-fallthrough skip-list to always exclude `data-rozie-ref` — a reserved compiler bookkeeping attribute, never a consumer prop. Previously a parent-assigned `ref=` on this component's own host tag could clobber the component's own internal `data-rozie-ref` markers via fallthrough re-application. No API change, no per-target behavior divergence.
- Updated dependencies [c279a7e]
  - @rozie/runtime-lit@0.2.1

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- ac09c50: Fix a keyboard hijack when an interactive element (a `<input>`, `<button>`, etc.) is rendered into a sortable row's default slot — the row's `onRowKeyDown` handler previously ran on any keydown that bubbled up to it, hijacking Space/Enter/Escape/Arrow keystrokes typed into the slotted child for lift/drop/move/cancel before the child ever saw them. Reorder keys now apply only when the row element ITSELF is focused; keystrokes originating from a slotted interactive child fall through untouched to that child. No API change, no per-target behavior divergence — the "editable row" pattern (a text input alongside drag-to-reorder) now works as expected.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [364f4c5]
