### Patch Changes

- 6943820: Lit and Angular dropped every leading comment on a top-level declaration promoted into
  the component class — 1370 apiece across the shipped corpus. Both emitters build each
  class member as a hand-built string (`generate(decl)` / `renderExpression` / a rebuilt
  arrow or `t.classMethod`), and none of those carries the STATEMENT's own comments, so an
  author's documentation simply vanished from the emitted component.

  Both now run a printed-comment ledger keyed on comment OBJECT IDENTITY. Identity rather
  than source offsets is load-bearing: a `.rzts` script partial is parsed as its own file,
  so its comment offsets collide with unrelated host comments. A per-branch rule cannot
  work here at all, because @babel/parser attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements
  to BOTH neighbours at once — whichever side a local rule picks, the other side either
  double-prints it or drops it.

  Three properties this needed, each found by measuring the corpus rather than by reading
  code:

  **It looks back, not just down.** Each statement claims the PREVIOUS statement's
  still-unclaimed trailing comments as well as its own leading ones, rendering both above
  its member. Inline, one parse hands the same comment object to both sides, so it prints
  once. Across a `.rzts` splice boundary the successor comes from a different parse with
  nothing attached, and the previous statement's trailing side is the only place the
  comment exists. Without this the inline host printed a comment the partial-inlined host
  could not, and the partial-vs-inline byte-identity guards went red.

  **The ledger spans the import block.** A comment between the last import and the first
  promoted declaration is printed by the module-scope import generation — a separate
  printer with its own dedup set. Unseeded, 132 comments printed twice on Lit and 155 on
  Angular. Seeding from every comment merely ATTACHED to an import node over-corrected and
  lost 16, since a comment can hang off a node the block never prints; the seed is taken
  from what the block actually emitted.

  **It unclaims.** A statement can be consumed by another pass — a `$computed`, a lifecycle
  hook, a `$provide` directive — and produce no class member at all. When the flush finds
  no target it releases the claim so whichever printer does emit that statement still
  renders its comments. Claiming without emitting is how a ledger silently drops comments,
  which is strictly worse than double-printing, and this is why both targets report zero
  lost despite several statement kinds never reaching a ledger-owned array.

  Net effect: 5311 comments restored across 53 Lit leaves and 5266 across the Angular
  leaves, with ZERO comments dropped and ZERO non-comment bytes changed, plus 16
  pre-existing double-prints fixed on each target (a comment that had been emitted both at
  module scope and again inside the mount hook). Verified by parsing every file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides — never by reading the diff.

  Emitted code is unchanged in every case; this is documentation fidelity only.

  Eighteen further Lit/Angular leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are
  deliberately absent from the front matter — dialog, lexical, listbox, maplibre,
  number-field, pagination, resizable, slider and switch (both targets) are all in
  `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and listing an ignored package beside a
  non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 78d5b5b: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `createRozieAttrApplier` and
  `createRozieHostAttrsReader` alongside the existing `RozieSlot`,
  `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken` exports. The Angular target
  used to inline a copy of the `r-bind`/`$attrs` spread attribute applier and
  host-attribute reader (~85 lines: three `WeakMap` prev-state caches, the
  class/style merge logic, and the host-attribute fold) as a private-field
  IIFE pair in _every_ emitted component that used `r-bind` spread or read
  `$attrs` — 158 tracked emitted files, of which 23 are shipped
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaf sources across 21 leaves.

  The emitted component keeps performing both `inject(Renderer2)` /
  `inject(ElementRef)` calls itself, in the same class-field initializer
  position; it now passes the resolved instance into the runtime factory
  (`createRozieAttrApplier(inject(Renderer2))`) instead of resolving it
  internally. Neither factory ever calls `inject()` or names an Angular
  type — both accept a structural interface (`RozieAttrRenderer`,
  `RozieHostRef`) — so this package still never resolves an Angular DI token
  itself, and the peer-keyed cross-package instance-identity hazard
  (`71dff1d5`) is structurally unreachable rather than merely tested against.

  Merge semantics, applied DOM output, and evaluation order are unchanged: a
  wrapper's own static `class` survives a spread that also sets `class`; a
  dropped `class`/`style` key removes only the tokens/properties this applier
  previously applied; an applied style still lands with `!important` priority,
  winning the last-write race against Angular's own `[ngClass]`/`ɵɵstyleMap`
  re-apply.

  A component using neither `r-bind` spread nor `$attrs` carries no new
  reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` — the import gate is keyed on whether
  the emitter actually pushed the corresponding field declaration, independent
  of the two Tier-1 gates (`rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr`/`rozieToken`,
  `RozieSlot`).

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Stale-publish reconciliation. The published `0.1.3` tarball predates several regenerations that landed on `main` without a version bump, so the registry kept serving stale bytes; the package had never even shipped a `CHANGELOG.md` before this release. This release republishes the current generated output:
  - Adds the `:host(rozie-captcha) { display: contents; }` component style to both `Captcha` and `RecaptchaV3` — the host element no longer imposes its own box in the layout.
  - Adds JSDoc across every prop of both components (0 blocks in the published tarball), so IDE tooltips/completion now describe each prop's semantics and, for `RecaptchaV3`, its `execute()`/`executeOnMount` behavior.
  - `LICENSE` copyright holder corrected from `Dan Krieger and Rozie.js contributors` to `One Learning Community LTD` (the repo's current holder — the worktree file was already correct; only the stale published tarball needed reconciling).
  - Internal-only: the `disposed` async-load guard local is now scoped correctly per emitter-hardening backlog item #2 (mount-local where only the mount closure's own async callbacks and its teardown read it; top-level only where an `$expose`'d imperative verb — `execute()`, `reset()`, `getResponse()` — must read it after unmount). `RecaptchaV3.execute()`'s optional `action` parameter is now emitted as a genuinely optional TS parameter (`action?: any`) rather than requiring a caller-visible `= null` default. No observable behavior change from either.
  - No prop/event/emit surface change.
