### Patch Changes

- 6274a5f: React's `useMemo` stabilization of an escaping top-level `const` was discovered by a
  ONE-LEVEL, NON-TRANSITIVE scan of `Listener.deps` / `LifecycleHook.setupDeps` — a
  `new X()` an effect reached only THROUGH a top-level helper (`buildState() ->
gutterCompartment.of(...)`) was invisible to that scan and never got `useMemo`, so React
  rebuilt it fresh every render. For an identity-keyed engine object (a CodeMirror6
  `Compartment`, a Map/WeakMap/Set used as cross-render scratch state) this silently no-ops
  any imperative API keyed on that instance's identity — CodeMirror's
  `scheduleReconfigure(compartment, ...)` against an `EditorState` that never saw the fresh
  Compartment being the corpus shape that surfaced this. All four turbo gates (build, test,
  dist-parity, typecheck) stayed green while the bug was live; only visual regression testing
  caught it.

  `computeEscapingNames` (`packages/targets/react/src/emit/computeEscapingNames.ts`) now runs
  a worklist-to-fixpoint over top-level helper bodies: a helper name reached by an
  effect/listener seed is walked (its body inspected for further references) but never itself
  promoted into the escaping set — only a non-function top-level `const` binder reached at any
  depth through that walk is added. This bound is deliberate: promoting a helper NAME into the
  escaping set would flip a hoisted `function` declaration back into a non-hoisted
  `useCallback` const, reopening the temporal-dead-zone class the emitter's plain-hoist branch
  exists to close, across 860+ shipped `function` declarations corpus-wide. The duplicated seed
  computation (previously maintained independently in two places in `emitScript.ts`) is now
  one shared computation, so the `useMemo`/`useCallback` wrap decision and the seam-3 staleness
  classification can never silently diverge.

  The CodeMirror unwind quick 260829-gbs had to revert (`5d48f9156`, because the two
  `code-mirror [react]` VR cells failed all retries under the pre-fix emitter) is re-landed:
  all six leaves regenerated from the fixed emitter, all ten CM6 `Compartment` instances now
  emit as `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` on React, and the five non-React leaves are
  byte-identical to the original unwind (`61bf99340`) — the emitter fix itself is React-only.

  Four other shipped React leaves carried a const of this exact shape and changed wrap form as
  an expected consequence, each individually inspected (correct empty dep array on a
  non-reactive initializer, no reactive-read case regressed to `[]`, no `.current`-read freeze
  hazard, and zero helper `function` declarations flipped form anywhere in the corpus):
  `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` (`GRID_PAGE_STEP`, `DATA_WRITE_TOKEN_KEY`, `SELECT_COL_ID`,
  `EXPANDER_COL_ID`), `@rozie-ui/rete-react` (`RESIZE_MIN_FALLBACK`, `CONN_WARN_SETTLE_MS`,
  `HISTORY_CAP`, `ZOOM_STEP`), and `@rozie-ui/toast-react` (`EXIT_FAILSAFE_MS`). Every one is a
  bare literal initializer reading nothing, so `[]` is the correct and complete dep array.

  **Emitted-comment fidelity — two structural fixes.** The component-scope emission loop mixes
  statements emitted as hand-built STRINGS (four `tryWrap*` passes) with statements emitted
  through a per-statement `@babel/generator` call, each of the latter carrying its own
  printed-comment dedup set. Because Babel attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements to
  BOTH neighbours at once, a shared comment printed TWICE (both neighbours rendered it) or ZERO
  times (neither did), depending purely on which pass claimed each side — and both failures
  were live in the shipped corpus simultaneously. No per-wrap rule can be right for both sides,
  so the decision moved to a block-wide printed-comment ledger keyed on comment object
  identity, which prints every comment exactly once in source order regardless of which pass
  claims either neighbour. This mirrors the single-dedup-set precedent `genBlockInner` and
  `genImportsBlock` already set for their own scopes.

  Separately, `hoistModuleLet` removed a hoisted `let`'s declaration from the component body
  and took the author's comment on that declaration with it. Those leading comments are now
  re-homed onto the nearest surviving neighbour before removal. This one was invisible from
  inside a single component: an inline host kept such a comment (its neighbour is one parse
  away and carries it as `trailingComments`) while the byte-identical `<script src>`
  partial-inlined host — whose spliced node comes from a DIFFERENT parse with no comments
  attached — lost it. `dist-parity`'s Phase 56-R8 / R11 partial-vs-inline byte-identity cells
  are what caught it.

  Net effect across the shipped React corpus: 2110 comment lines restored, 187 duplicate
  prints removed, and **zero** comments dropped and **zero** non-comment bytes changed —
  verified line-by-line against the pre-change corpus. Fifteen further React leaves are bumped
  here for that comment-fidelity restoration alone, with no code change:
  `@rozie-ui/captcha-react`, `chartjs-react`, `combobox-react`, `command-palette-react`,
  `cropper-react`, `date-picker-react`, `embla-react`, `flatpickr-react`, `otp-react`,
  `pdf-react`, `popover-react`, `sortable-list-react`, `tags-react`, `tiptap-react`, and
  `wavesurfer-react`.

  Nine more React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately OMITTED from
  the front matter: `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package alongside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail
  outright — the exact breakage `8865e96df` repaired, not reintroduced here.

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-react@0.6.0

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Mount-time staleness fix. Values read inside `$onMount` are now mirrored through synced refs, so a callback registered once at mount no longer reads the first render's values for the lifetime of the component. A consumer that changes a prop — or passes a new handler identity — after mount is now observed by the mount-registered callback instead of being silently ignored.

  All three read kinds landed here, across both components:
  - **Prop reads** — `provider` (`Captcha`); `executeOnMount` and `sitekey` (`RecaptchaV3`). Changing the provider or sitekey after mount is now seen by the mount-time API loader instead of being pinned to the first render.
  - **Helper calls** — `buildConfig()` (`Captcha`) and `execute()` (`RecaptchaV3`), so the widget is rendered with the config as it stands at call time.
  - **`$emit` handler prop** — `onError`. A consumer that swaps its error handler after mount now actually receives `error`.

- The mount effect's dependency array is now honest, so the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppression is no longer emitted (both components).
- No API surface change: same props, same events, same imperative handle.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. Declared emit handlers were also landing in the root DOM fallthrough spread and firing twice per emit — the emitter now keeps them out of it. No API surface change.
