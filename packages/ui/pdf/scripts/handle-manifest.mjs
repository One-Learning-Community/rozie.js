/**
 * Hand-kept imperative-handle method-description manifest for @rozie-ui/pdf.
 *
 * The exposed methods are derived structurally from the source via `ir.expose`
 * (the Phase 21 `$expose({ ... })` call in PdfViewer.rozie), but their
 * human-readable descriptions have no first-class IR source — so the prose lives
 * here.
 *
 * KEYS MUST stay in lockstep with `ir.expose`: codegen.mjs asserts every exposed
 * method name has an entry here and throws if one is missing.
 *
 * Collision discipline (ROZ121/ROZ524/Lit-lifecycle): none of these 19 verbs
 * collides with an emitted event name (NO bare `load`/`error`/`pagechange`/
 * `pagesrendered`/`passwordrequest`/`progress`/`findresult`), the React
 * `page`-model auto-setter (NO `setPage` — navigate via `goToPage(n)`; the
 * two-way `page` binding reads it), or a Lit reserved lifecycle name. Every verb
 * drives `$data` (or reads the loaded document), so it works whether or not the
 * consumer two-way-binds `page`.
