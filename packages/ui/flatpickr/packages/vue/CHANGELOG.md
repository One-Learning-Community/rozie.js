# @rozie-ui/flatpickr-vue

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- cf49212: Regenerated with the compiler fixes found while building `@rozie-ui/select`. Depending on the target and the component:
  - Angular: a two-way (`model: true`) prop is now controlled while the consumer binds a value — a write by the component only emits `<name>Change`, so a consumer that refuses the change keeps the control on its value. The prop keeps its `ModelSignal` type. `$onUpdate` hooks now run (after every render); they never ran before. An output named like a native bubbling event (`change`, `submit`, `reset`, `select`) no longer also delivers the native event to a consumer's binding.
  - Vue: a two-way prop bound one-way (`:value` without `v-model`) is now controlled too: the component's write emits `update:value` and the control keeps the consumer's value.
  - React: an `$expose` verb now runs in `flushSync`, so calls made in one tick each see what the call before left; primitive script constants are plain `const`s; a body statement no longer reads a binding declared after it on the first render.
  - Svelte, Solid: a `$watch` now sees a `$data` write made in `$onMount`.
  - Lit: a `$watch` whose getter reads both props and `$data` re-runs when only the prop changes; duplicated comments in lifecycle bodies are gone.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- a113f0e: Vue leaves: `@example` snippets in prop documentation now use Vue syntax

  The published tarballs for these seven leaves still carried Rozie authoring
  notation inside their `@example` JSDoc blocks — `r-model:data="crop"` where a
  Vue consumer should see `v-model:data="crop"`. Hovering a prop in an editor
  showed markup that is not valid in the framework you are actually using.

  The fix landed in source on 2026-08-24 but these seven were never bumped, so
  npm kept serving the old bytes (`pnpm publish` silently skips an already-
  published version). Documentation comments only — no runtime code, type
  signature, or import changed.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated with the toolchain's Vue `$watch` flush:'post' fix: all `$watch`-driven prop/data reconcilers now run post-flush (after the DOM update, matching the React/Solid/Svelte/Angular/Lit leaves' timing) instead of Vue's default pre-flush. This closes the portal re-entrancy class (a portal fill mounting from inside an engine update can no longer synchronously flush a pending sibling watcher into the same engine mid-update) and the pre-flush `$refs`-read-too-early class (e.g. the embla runtime `thumbnails` toggle previously failed to build its thumb engine on Vue). No API surface change.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Stale-publish reconciliation. The published `0.1.1` tarball predates several regenerations that landed on `main` without a version bump, so the registry kept serving stale bytes; the package had never even shipped a `CHANGELOG.md` before this release. This release republishes the current generated output:
  - Adds JSDoc across the component's props (0 blocks in the published tarball), so IDE tooltips/completion now describe each prop's semantics, runtime-vs-construction-time mutability, and defaults.
  - `LICENSE` copyright holder corrected from `Dan Krieger and Rozie.js contributors` to `One Learning Community LTD` (the repo's current holder — the worktree file was already correct; only the stale published tarball needed reconciling).
  - No prop/event/emit surface change (Vue does not use a shadow host, so unlike the Angular leaf there is no `display: contents` host style involved here).
