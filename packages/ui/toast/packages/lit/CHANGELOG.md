# @rozie-ui/toast-lit

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- `@rozie/runtime-lit` gains a new public export, `RozieSlotDistributor` — a reactive
  controller that performs manual slot assignment for a Lit shadow root, used wherever a
  component needs to route projected children into loop-generated `<slot>` targets
  (e.g. carousel slides). Adopting manual `slotAssignment` turns OFF the browser's
  automatic Text-node projection for that shadow root: raw text children must now be
  assigned to a slot explicitly, and any code reading `assignedNodes()` needs to guard
  for the manual-assignment case. A host that adopts the controller needs its
  `shadowRootOptions` typed as `ShadowRootInit`.

  `@rozie/core` adds two new compile-time diagnostics and one new template sigil:
  - **ROZ148** — flags a prop whose name collides with an emitted callback name, before
    it becomes a runtime shadowing bug on a target that lowers the prop to a method.
  - **ROZ210** — flags a reserved slot name so it can't silently collide with an
    internally-generated one.
  - **`$slotted`** — a new member sigil authors can read inside a loop to get the live,
    reactively-assigned elements projected into that iteration's slot.

  `@rozie/{cli,unplugin,babel-plugin}` bundle `@rozie/core`'s compiler, so this release
  carries the same diagnostics and `$slotted` lowering through to every consumer of
  those packages — the compiler itself moved even though none of these three changed
  their own source. `$slotted` lowers to a reactive assigned-elements signal on the Lit
  target (backed by `RozieSlotDistributor`, gated behind a new `shouldDistributeSlots`
  check so it only emits where a loop actually needs manual slot assignment) and to a
  plain `[]` on the five hostless targets (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular), where
  there's no shadow root to distribute into.

  `@rozie/runtime-{react,vue,svelte,solid,keynav-core}` are version-aligned to 0.5.0 by
  the changesets `fixed` group riding the `runtime-lit` minor above — this is a
  version-alignment release only; none of these five packages has a source or behavior
  change in this wave.

  `@rozie-ui/date-picker-*` (all six targets) — day and caption labels are now derived
  from `Intl`, with a new `labels` prop for overriding them; range-span selections now
  validate against `disabled` dates; and the calendar header adds drill-in/drill-out
  navigation verbs.

  `@rozie-ui/embla-*` (all six targets) adopts `$slotted` for its carousel slides. On
  the Lit target specifically, this closes a real projection gap: raw `slot="slide"`
  children are now distributed per-iteration instead of only the first iteration
  claiming them.

  `@rozie-ui/{combobox,command-palette,data-table,sortable-list,tags,toast}-lit` are
  regenerated against the new Lit emitter output above — each already used a loop-slot
  pattern that now runs through `RozieSlotDistributor` / `$slotted` instead of the prior
  ad hoc approach, with no observable behavior change for existing consumers of these
  specific leaves.

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. `r-for` loop keys are no longer leaked as literal DOM attributes on emitted elements. No API surface change.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c279a7e: Fix the `$attrs` auto-fallthrough skip-list to always exclude `data-rozie-ref` — a reserved compiler bookkeeping attribute, never a consumer prop. Previously a parent-assigned `ref=` on this component's own host tag could clobber the component's own internal `data-rozie-ref` markers via fallthrough re-application. No API change, no per-target behavior divergence.

### Minor Changes

- a7bc443: Toast UX cluster — closes the four previously-deferred `@rozie-ui/toast` UX items in one wave:
  - **Precise remaining-time hover pause.** Hovering the stack now stores each timer's exact remainder instead of a full restart — a 1000ms toast hovered ~600ms in and released dismisses ~400ms later, not after a fresh 1000ms.
  - **The family's first event, `@dismissed { toast, reason }`.** Every dismissal (timer expiry, the close button, the `dismiss()` verb, or a swipe) routes through one funnel and fires `dismissed` exactly once, before a new CSS enter/exit animation lifecycle runs; `clear()` stays bulk and fires nothing.
  - **`patch(id, changes)` and `promise(p, { loading, success, error })`.** `patch` updates an existing toast in place (message/type/duration, with duration-key timer restart semantics). `promise` shows a `{ type: 'loading' }` spinner toast synchronously and flips it to success/error at settle — the timer starts at settle, and a toast dismissed while pending is never resurrected.
  - **Pointer swipe-to-dismiss**, on by default (`disableSwipe` opts out): direction auto-derived from `position`, a 45%-width/velocity threshold, rubber-band on the wrong direction, and spring-back below threshold.
  - **An opt-in `stacked` collapsed stack**: a sonner-style depth-driven grid overlay (newest on top, depth 3+ hidden) that expands to the normal flex column on hover or keyboard focus.
  - 6 new theming tokens (`--rozie-toast-enter-duration`, `--rozie-toast-exit-duration`, `--rozie-toast-stack-offset`, `--rozie-toast-stack-scale-step`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-size`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-color`) with preset mappings across the shadcn/Material/Bootstrap theme bridges.

  The public surface grows from 5 props / 0 events / 3-verb handle to 7 props / 1 event / 5-verb handle; the `toast` scoped slot and all five existing props are unchanged. No breaking changes.
