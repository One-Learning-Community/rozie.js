## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a9d67cb: Typed public surface, phase 1: a component can now declare real TypeScript types for its events, slot parameters and imperative handle, and a consumer on any target sees them instead of `any`. See the new guide, "Typed public surface".

  Four opt-in authoring features (a component that uses none of them compiles exactly as before; all are types-only, with no runtime change on any target):
  - `<types>` block: type-only statements (`import type`, `interface`, `type`, and `export` of those) hoisted into every target and re-exported from the package entry. Anything else is an error (ROZ019, ROZ020). A `<types>` import that clashes with a `<script>` import is ROZ024; an identical duplicate is dropped silently. A `<types>` name that collides with a generated name (`<Name>Props`, `<Name>Handle`, `Rozie<Name>EventMap`, slot context interfaces, …), with a name the compiled module imports (a `<components>` key, its `<Local>Handle`, or a framework / `@rozie/runtime-*` import such as `ReactNode` or `TemplateRef`, reserved on every target), or with a top-level `<script>` declaration is ROZ025.
  - `<emits>` block: `{ name: { payload?: '<type>', docs?: {...} } }`. When present it is the complete list: an undeclared `$emit` is an error (ROZ151), reported at the `$emit` call, and a declared event that is never emitted is a warning (ROZ152), reported at its `<emits>` entry. A `$emit` whose argument count does not match the declared payload is a warning (ROZ157), reported at the call. Invalid entries (including a repeated event name or `payload`/`docs` key), types and docs are ROZ021, ROZ022 and ROZ023. React and Solid get `onX?: (payload: P) => void`, Vue a typed `defineEmits`, Svelte a lowercase `onx` callback, Angular `output<P>()`, and Lit a `CustomEvent<P>` with a generated `Rozie<Name>EventMap` and typed `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` overloads.
  - `<slot :param-types="{ row: 'Row' }">` types a slot parameter (unknown key ROZ153, malformed value ROZ154).
  - `$expose(verbs, signatures)`: a compile-time-only second argument typing the handle (unknown verb ROZ155, malformed ROZ156). The signature strings are stripped from every emitted module. A verb without a signature keeps its implementation's own types when it has them (a return-type annotation or an annotated `const`, in `<script lang="ts">`) on every target; only a fully untyped verb is `(...args: any[]) => any`.

  Also in this release:
  - The component manifest (`rozie-manifest.json`) is schema v2 and carries emit payloads, expose signatures, the `<types>` text and slot `:param-types`. The reader still accepts v1, so composing an already-published v1 package keeps working. Composing a package whose leaves ship a v2 manifest (`@rozie-ui/popover`, `@rozie-ui/combobox`, …) from your own `.rozie` requires `@rozie/*` at or above this release; a compiler that is too old now says so in ROZ988 (upgrade the toolchain) instead of advising a reinstall of the primitive.
  - `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars now carry `<types>` and type slots and events exactly as each compiled module does. Apart from `<types>`, these changes apply to every component, not only to ones that use the new features: Solid `<slot>Slot` props and JSX.Element shapes; Svelte Snippet shapes and lowercase handler names; no spurious `render<X>` props on Vue, Angular and Lit (Lit declares its slot receivers on the element class instead); no `on<X>` props on Lit; and on Angular, every component with events loses its spurious `on<Event>` props, and the declared class gets typed `OutputEmitterRef<T>` outputs from the same derivation as the compiled `output()` fields (`T` is the declared payload, otherwise `void`, or `unknown` when an untyped `$emit` passes a payload). The `<Name>Handle` of an `$expose` component now keeps the type of a verb declared as an annotated `const` (`const add: AddFn = …`) instead of `(...args: any[]) => any` (or the implementation's own signature). A Solid scoped default slot now accepts a function child.
  - Text such as `<script`, `<style`, `<title` or `<textarea` inside a `<types>`, `<emits>`, `<props>`, `<data>`, `<listeners>` or `<components>` body (in a comment, a docs string, or a generic like `Array<Style>`) no longer desynchronises the block splitter. Those bodies are now opaque to the HTML tokenizer.

  Untyped-handler convergence (the one planned typing change for components that do not opt in; the sidecar fixes above reach them too): an untyped event handler is now `(...args: any[]) => void` on every target. The shared `.d.ts` sidecar, Solid and Svelte used to emit `unknown[]`, which rejected handlers written with a concrete parameter type; React already used `any[]`. The generated sources of the Solid and Svelte leaves (and the React `.d.ts`) change accordingly, hence the patch bumps. `@rozie-ui/sortable-list-solid` and `@rozie-ui/switch-solid` also pick up the scoped-default-slot function-child fix.

  `@rozie-ui/popover-*` and `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar-*` adopt the features and are bumped minor, because typed events can reject a previously accepted wrong-typed handler:
  - popover: the `anchor` slot context is typed (including the new `panelId: string`) and the handle (`show`, `hide`, `toggle`, `reposition`) is typed. Its open state's change event is the `open` model's (Lit: `open-change`, now in `RoziePopoverEventMap` as `CustomEvent<boolean>`).
  - fullcalendar: 11 typed events (for example `eventClick` with `jsEvent: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent`, and `unselect` with `jsEvent: UIEvent | null`), 10 typed portal slot arguments and 16 typed handle verbs. The `<types>` names are re-exported from every package entry, and the package barrels re-export the handle types and Lit event maps.
  - Both families generate their README event tables from `<emits>` and no longer ship `scripts/event-manifest.mjs`.

- a9d67cb: Props types now accept the root element's HTML attributes when a component passes attributes through to a single root element (typed public surface, phase 3).
  - React: `interface XProps extends Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'<tag>'>, …>` — `className`, `style`, `id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, element-specific attributes (`disabled` on a `<button>` root, …) and DOM listeners typecheck without a cast.
  - Solid: the same with `ComponentProps<'<tag>'>`.
  - Svelte: `interface Props extends Omit<SvelteHTMLElements['<tag>'], …>` replaces `[key: string]: unknown`. **This is stricter:** an attribute the root element does not support, which the old index signature accepted, is now a type error.
  - The component's own props win on a name collision. `children` stays rejected when the component has no default slot, as do the content-replacing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) and `innerHTML` / `innerText` / `textContent` (Solid).
  - An `<svg>` root gets the SVG element's attributes (`fill`, `stroke`, `viewBox`, …). Any other non-HTML root (a custom element) gets the generic `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` on React and Solid, and Svelte's permissive custom-element entry.
  - Components with `inherit-attrs="false"`, an `r-if` root or a component root are unchanged. Vue, Angular and Lit are unchanged; they already accepted pass-through attributes.

  The `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars (React, Solid, Svelte) carry the same types. Types only — no runtime change.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 64cebc6: The imperative handle's `show`/`dismiss`/`clear`/`patch`/`promise` methods now carry their real action/data-aware TypeScript signatures in every target's declaration output, instead of the untyped `(...args: any[]) => any` catch-all.

  `show()` and `patch()` were already functionally action/data-aware at runtime — both accept `{ message, type, duration, action: { label, onClick }, data }`, exactly as the README's Undo example documents — but none of the five methods carried an explicit TypeScript return-type annotation in the Rozie source, so every target's declaration emitter fell back to the untyped catch-all shape. A consumer typing `show({ actoin: {...} })` (typo) or misusing `patch()` got zero compile-time help.

  Purely a type-accuracy fix: no runtime behavior changed on any target.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f2148d: A toast can now carry an action and pass-through data, from a dogfooding report: `show()`
  whitelisted `id`/`message`/`type`/`duration` and silently dropped everything else, so an "Undo"
  toast previously needed the `#toast` slot plus a side map from toast id to action.
  - `show({ action: { label, onClick } })` renders an action button in the default toast;
    clicking it calls `onClick({ id, data })` and dismisses with a new dismiss reason, `'action'`.
    An action with no `onClick` function is dropped — no dead button ships.
  - `show({ data })` carries any payload through untouched, available in the `#toast` slot's scope
    (`toast.data`), the `dismissed` payload, and the action callback.
  - `patch(id, { action, data })` can update both, so a promise-toast can gain its "Undo" action
    once it resolves.
  - The action button inherits the toast's own colour, matching every type variant. No new public
    theming token yet.

  Purely additive: `dismissed` can now also report reason `'action'`; existing consumers of
  `show()`/`patch()` are unaffected.

  **Theming — design-system bridges now yield to an ancestor's own tokens, and apply correctly on
  Lit.** Same fix as every other themed family in this release — see the `@rozie-ui/data-table`
  changeset in this release for the full description of the bridge-scoping defect and its fix.

  **Solid packaging.** `@rozie-ui/toast-solid` ships the same compiled-JS-by-default,
  JSX-under-the-`solid`-condition packaging shape as every other published Solid leaf this release
  — see the dedicated Solid packaging changeset for the full description. No API change.

### Patch Changes

- 4f2148d: Fixed: the `themes/*.css` design-token bridge files' example `import` line named the wrong package (`@rozie-ui/<family>-react`) on every non-React target — copied byte-for-byte from one canonical source. It now names `@rozie-ui/toast-solid`, this package's own.
- 4f2148d: Fixed two pre-release defects in the `action`/`data` API above before its first publish:
  - An action's `onClick` that threw an error used to leave its toast stuck forever (the
    dismiss never ran). `runAction` now dismisses with reason `'action'` in a `finally` block —
    the dismiss always happens, and the error itself still propagates (never silently
    swallowed).
  - The auto-dismiss timer now pauses on keyboard focus, not just pointer hover: tabbing to a
    toast's action (or close) button pauses it with the same exact-remainder precision as
    hover, so a keyboard user reading or acting on a toast never loses it to the timeout
    mid-interaction (WCAG 2.2.1). Hover-pause and focus-pause compose — leaving one does not
    resume the timer while the other is still active — and this is unconditional, not gated by
    `disablePauseOnHover`.
  - @rozie/runtime-solid@0.7.5
- 4f2148d: **Fixed: a consumer `class` on `<Toaster>` no longer replaces the component's own
  `rozie-toaster` class.** The root toast region merges its `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` handlers with
  the consumer's own pass-through props (so a consumer-supplied native listener still fires
  alongside them, R6 all-fire); that merge previously carried the WHOLE pass-through props bucket —
  not just its listener keys — and re-applied the untouched `class` at the tail of the element's
  JSX attribute list, silently overwriting the value Toaster had already merged one attribute
  earlier. Verified: `<Toaster class="my-toaster" />` used to render `class="my-toaster"`; it now
  renders `class="rozie-toaster ... my-toaster"`. No API change.
- 4f2148d: **Fixed: published Solid leaves now ship compiled JavaScript for `import`/`require`, with JSX
  kept only under the `solid` export condition.**

  Every `@rozie-ui/*-solid` leaf with markup previously shipped Solid JSX inside
  `dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` under a plain `import`/`require` (`chartjs-solid` renders no markup of its
  own, but ships the same corrected export shape for consistency with its siblings). That is not
  valid JavaScript on its own — a default `vite-plugin-solid` setup
  fails with "JSX syntax is disabled" (the plugin only transforms `.[mc]?[jt]sx` files), and any
  bundler without a Solid plugin fails outright. The only way to consume these packages was to
  manually point `vite-plugin-solid` at the package's `.mjs` files inside `node_modules` — a
  workaround, not a supported shape.

  New export shape (the standard one for a published Solid library):
  - `import` / `require` → `dist/<entry>.{mjs,cjs}`, compiled to plain DOM output by
    `babel-preset-solid`. Any bundler consumes this with no Solid plugin at all.
  - `solid` (export condition) → `dist/source/<entry>.jsx`, JSX kept intact. `vite-plugin-solid`
    and SolidStart resolve this condition first and compile it themselves for their own mode (DOM /
    SSR / hydration).

  **If you were using the `extensions: ['.mjs']` / `node_modules` `include` workaround with
  `vite-plugin-solid` to consume one of these packages, remove it — it is no longer needed** and a
  default `vite-plugin-solid` setup now resolves the `solid` condition correctly on its own. No
  public API change on any of these leaves.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Solid: slot scope values are now passed as lazy getters instead of eager reads.

  A scoped slot invocation used to build its param object as `{ open: open() }`. Because that object is constructed inside the JSX insert that invokes the slot, Solid subscribed the **insert itself** to every signal read while building it — so any change re-ran the insert, re-invoked the consumer's slot function, and replaced the rendered subtree. Emitting `{ get open() { return open(); } }` defers the read into the consumer's own reactive scope, which is Solid's own convention for passing reactive props.

  Observable fix: opening the data-table column menu no longer tears the just-focused trigger out of the DOM, so the documented "Escape returns focus to the trigger" guarantee now holds on Solid as it already did on the other five targets.

  Literals and function-valued expressions are deliberately left as plain properties — neither can read a signal, and wrapping a function would hand the consumer a new identity on every property access.

  Note for consumers: destructuring a slot scope (`({ option, index }) => …`) and spreading it behave exactly as before. The one behavior change is that **assigning** to a scope property now throws `TypeError: Cannot set property x of #<Object> which has only a getter`, where it previously succeeded silently. Writing to a slot scope was never a supported pattern.

  `@rozie/core` is named here even though no file under `packages/core/` changed: the emitter lives in the private `@rozie/target-solid` package, which is bundled into core's published dist (and into `unplugin`, `babel-plugin`, and `cli`). A changeset derived from changed paths alone would ship a toolchain that still emits the bug.

### Minor Changes

- a7bc443: Toast UX cluster — closes the four previously-deferred `@rozie-ui/toast` UX items in one wave:
  - **Precise remaining-time hover pause.** Hovering the stack now stores each timer's exact remainder instead of a full restart — a 1000ms toast hovered ~600ms in and released dismisses ~400ms later, not after a fresh 1000ms.
  - **The family's first event, `@dismissed { toast, reason }`.** Every dismissal (timer expiry, the close button, the `dismiss()` verb, or a swipe) routes through one funnel and fires `dismissed` exactly once, before a new CSS enter/exit animation lifecycle runs; `clear()` stays bulk and fires nothing.
  - **`patch(id, changes)` and `promise(p, { loading, success, error })`.** `patch` updates an existing toast in place (message/type/duration, with duration-key timer restart semantics). `promise` shows a `{ type: 'loading' }` spinner toast synchronously and flips it to success/error at settle — the timer starts at settle, and a toast dismissed while pending is never resurrected.
  - **Pointer swipe-to-dismiss**, on by default (`disableSwipe` opts out): direction auto-derived from `position`, a 45%-width/velocity threshold, rubber-band on the wrong direction, and spring-back below threshold.
  - **An opt-in `stacked` collapsed stack**: a sonner-style depth-driven grid overlay (newest on top, depth 3+ hidden) that expands to the normal flex column on hover or keyboard focus.
  - 6 new theming tokens (`--rozie-toast-enter-duration`, `--rozie-toast-exit-duration`, `--rozie-toast-stack-offset`, `--rozie-toast-stack-scale-step`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-size`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-color`) with preset mappings across the shadcn/Material/Bootstrap theme bridges.

  The public surface grows from 5 props / 0 events / 3-verb handle to 7 props / 1 event / 5-verb handle; the `toast` scoped slot and all five existing props are unchanged. No breaking changes.
