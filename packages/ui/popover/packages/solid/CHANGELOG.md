### Minor Changes

- f1fd891: Combobox gains multi-select, a floating-positioned popup, and creatable mode; popover gains two opt-in composition primitives; command-palette's combobox peer moves to admit the new minor.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — multi-select via a widened model, not a second one.** A new `multiple: Boolean` prop (default `false`) turns the existing sole `value` model into an array of selected values — there is still only one `model: true` prop, so `[formControl]` / `[(ngModel)]` binding on Angular is unaffected. Re-selecting a selected option toggles it off; selected values render as chips in selection order through a new `#chip` scoped slot (`{ option, remove, index }`); duplicate values dedupe to one chip; a chip whose option later disappears from `options` persists, labelled by its raw value; Backspace on an empty query removes the last chip. `aria-multiselectable="true"` and per-option `aria-selected` are present on the listbox when `multiple` is on. Works across all four render branches (plain, `groups`, `groups`+`groupCap`, `virtual`).

  The `change` event payload gains a `selected` field — the direction of the toggle (`true` when a value was added, `false` when removed or after `clear()`). This is purely additive for existing single-select consumers destructuring `{ value, option }`: `selected` is simply a new property, always `true` for a single-select pick.

  **Consumer-visible DOM change under `multiple`:** selected chips render as a `<ul class="rozie-combobox-chips">` inside the composed popover's anchor content, immediately before the `<input>`, guarded solely on `multiple` — so the chip rail plus the input together become what the floating popup's `matchWidth` measures. Consumer CSS that targets `.rozie-combobox`'s direct children may need attention when opting into `multiple`; the non-`multiple` DOM shape is unchanged.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — floating-positioned popup, composed rather than reimplemented.** The popup is now positioned by Floating UI through the published `@rozie-ui/popover` leaf (a new `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` peer on all six leaves) rather than static CSS: it flips and shifts to stay on screen near a viewport edge. `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, and `disableShift` forward to the composed popover. Under `inline`, a Popover is still mounted — what `inline` switches off is positioning and dismissal, via `disablePositioning` and `disableDismiss`; the list continues to render through the same composed popover as the floating mode.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — creatable mode.** A new `creatable: Boolean` prop (default `false`). When committed text matches no existing option (case-insensitive, trimmed, exact label match), combobox emits a new `create` event with the query string and writes nothing to `value` — the consumer owns adding the option and updating the model. The create affordance renders last, through a new `#create` scoped slot, after all options and group sections. Composes with `multiple`.

  **`@rozie-ui/popover` — five new opt-in, gated capabilities, shipping as a MINOR.** All six leaves land on `0.2.0` in this wave. `bare: Boolean` strips Popover's own positioning wrapper output down to a minimal unstyled surface — for a composing component (like combobox's floating mode) that wants Popover's mount/dismiss lifecycle without its default chrome. `disablePositioning: Boolean` takes the panel out of Floating UI's positioning path entirely, so it participates in ordinary document flow instead of being absolutely positioned — this is what `inline` mode now relies on, and it previously had no release note at all. `keepMounted: Boolean` hides the floating panel instead of unmounting it (a one-shot position on mount, `autoUpdate` still strictly open-gated) — useful for a composed virtualizer whose scroll container must survive close/open. `matchWidth: Boolean` matches the panel's width exactly to its anchor via Floating UI's `size` middleware, width-only. `disableDismiss: Boolean` suppresses Popover's own Escape-key and click-outside dismissal listeners — for a composing component that drives `open` itself and needs to veto Popover's independent dismissal while a host sub-surface anchored to (but not nested inside) the composed control legitimately holds focus. All five default to `false`; existing click/hover/focus, non-`bare`, non-`disablePositioning`, non-`keepMounted`, non-`matchWidth`, non-`disableDismiss` consumers see no behavioral or visual change to the pre-wave 12-prop surface — verified via an additive-only `.d.ts` diff and Docker VR runs with zero unexplained baseline diffs. Three CSS rules were ADDED to support these capabilities (`--static`, `--bare`, `--hidden`); the pre-existing rule set is itself unchanged, but a reader should not infer that no rules were added at all.

  Two caveats existing consumers should know before adopting either capability: **`matchWidth` is not reversible** — there is no `$watch` and no code path that ever clears the inline `style.width` the `size` middleware writes once applied, so a consumer that toggles `matchWidth` off at runtime will see the stale width persist. And **existing `trigger="manual"` consumers DO see an emitted-DOM change**: `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` were unconditional pre-wave and are now gated on a new `hasGestureTrigger()` check (`trigger === 'click' || 'hover' || 'focus'`), so a `trigger="manual"` popover no longer emits those two attributes.

  **`@rozie-ui/command-palette` — combobox peer range widens; the FILES and the COMPONENT tell two different stories.** All six leaves widen their `@rozie-ui/combobox-<target>` peer from `^0.4.0` to `^0.5.0`. A caret range on a 0.x version pins the minor, so the previous range does not admit combobox's incoming `0.5.0` — every leaf moves in this same wave or the published command-palette leaves become uninstallable against the combobox version they actually need.

  **File-truth:** zero source drift. The complete diff across all six `@rozie-ui/command-palette-<target>` leaves is six `package.json` peer lines, independently confirmed by a published-tarball audit showing all six leaves drifting on `package.json:manifest` only.

  **Component-truth:** the rendered component is not unchanged, because it composes combobox and inherits combobox's own popover composition. It now unconditionally mounts a Popover, adding `.rozie-popover-anchor` / `.rozie-popover-floating` wrapper elements to the DOM; it gains an unconditional `queueMicrotask` focus re-assertion routed through combobox's `onFocus` on all six targets; and `pinned` moves from a module-scope `let` to reactive `$data`. `command-palette` itself still uses `inline` (never floats). The command-palette audit traced all three of these and found no defect follows from any of them — noted here so a reader relying on "peer range only" does not miss real, if inert, DOM and behavior changes.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. The `splitProps` skip-list now correctly excludes emit-handler props from the root DOM fallthrough spread — previously a consumer's handler fired twice per emit. No API surface change.
