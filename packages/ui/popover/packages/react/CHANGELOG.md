# @rozie-ui/popover-react

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 024ef2c: The floating panel no longer carries `aria-modal` unless it is a dialog. `aria-modal` is only valid on `role="dialog"` / `alertdialog`, yet every panel rendered `aria-modal="false"`, including the default role-neutral click popover (also when `bare`, hosting your own `role="dialog"` content) and `role="tooltip"` panels, which axe reports as `aria-allowed-attr`. The attribute is now omitted there. With `modal` set, the panel still renders `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- d8de713: A popover placed to the side of its anchor (`left*` / `right*`) now stays inside the viewport on a narrow screen: when neither side has room it falls back to below or above the anchor, and when nothing fits it slides back into view. It used to stay on the side that overflowed least, cut off by the viewport edge; on a 390px-wide screen a `right-start` panel could end with its right edge past 500px. `top*` / `bottom*` placements are positioned exactly as before.

  The panel is never wider than the area it is positioned in. Popover measures that width while it tracks the anchor and publishes it on the panel as `--rozie-popover-available-width`; the built-in `max-width` is the smaller of that and `--rozie-popover-max-width`, and a `bare` panel's own content can use the property for its own cap. `disableShift` turns the measured limit off along with the shift, and the property is removed from the panel whenever positioning stops (the popover closes, or `disablePositioning` turns on), so a stale measurement never caps a panel that is no longer tracked. Turning `disablePositioning` on while the popover is open now also removes the inline `left` / `top` (and an inline `position: fixed` or `matchWidth` width) that positioning had written, which used to beat the static layout and leave the in-flow panel at its old floating coordinates.

  The panel is now `box-sizing: border-box`, so the `max-width` cap includes its padding and border (a default panel with long content was 26px wider than the cap, wider than a narrow viewport), and a `matchWidth` panel with its own chrome matches the anchor's width exactly.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 36d4469: `onChange` is now typed `never` with a @deprecated note pointing at `onOpenChange`; it used to type-check as the native change handler and never fire. The `change` event was removed in 0.3.0, but `PopoverProps` extends the root `<div>`'s HTML attributes, so `<Popover onChange={…}>` still compiled as the DOM `change` handler. React and Solid now reject it with the note, and so does Svelte for `onchange` (use `bind:open`). Vue, Angular and Lit are unchanged; they get a version bump only.
- 36d4469: `idBase` now defaults to `''`, and each popover generates a unique id base after mount (`rozie-popover-<n>`). Every popover left at the default used to get the panel id `rozie-popover-panel`, so two open popovers shared an id and the anchor's `aria-controls` / `aria-describedby` could point at the wrong panel. An explicit `idBase` is used as before, and the `anchor` slot's `panelId` follows the generated id.

  The README and docs now explain that the root is `display: contents`: a `class` or `style` you pass reaches it, but only inherited properties (color, font, the `--rozie-popover-*` tokens) take effect there. To place a popover in a flex row or grid, wrap it in your own element.

  Lit: a popover that re-rendered before its first open (for example after a prop change) could open unpositioned, in normal flow instead of floating at the anchor, because positioning started before the panel had rendered. Positioning now waits for the panel.

- c362398: The npm package now includes `CHANGELOG.md`. It was written for every release but left out of the tarball, because npm no longer adds a changelog by itself, so a behaviour change recorded there (such as the 0.7.0 combobox Ctrl/Cmd/Alt+Enter change) was invisible to anyone reading the installed package.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a9d67cb: Add a `reference` prop for positioning the popover against an external or virtual element.

  Before this, `Popover` could only measure its own anchor wrapper, which holds whatever you project into the `anchor` slot. It could not open next to an element that another component renders, such as a calendar event element. The workaround was a `position: fixed` wrapper sized to that element's rect. Now you can pass the element directly:
  - **`reference`** (`Element | Object`, default `null`) takes either a DOM Element or a Floating UI [virtual element](https://floating-ui.com/docs/virtual-elements), which is any object with `getBoundingClientRect()` plus an optional `contextElement`. Use a virtual element to open at a pointer position.
  - **Positioning:** the panel is positioned and tracked against the reference with Floating UI's `autoUpdate`. Changing `reference` while the popover is open repositions it against the new reference.
  - **Dismissal:** a click on (or inside) a referenced Element does not count as an outside click, so a toggle on that element closes the panel instead of dismissing it and reopening it. A virtual element adds no inside region. Escape dismissal is unchanged.
  - **ARIA:** with `reference`, you own the trigger ARIA (`aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`) on your own element. Pair it with `trigger="manual"` and a two-way-bound `open`.
  - **Stable value:** pass the same element or object across renders. A new object on every render restarts tracking.

  The click-outside listener now receives the DOM event on every framework.

  `reference` is additive: it defaults to `null`, which keeps the built-in anchor and behaves exactly as before. (This popover release does carry one breaking change, the removal of the `change` event; see its own entry.)

- a9d67cb: **Breaking: the `change` event is removed.** Use the `open` model's own change event, which carries the same boolean and fires at the same moments:

  | Target        | Before     | Now                                |
  | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | Vue           | `@change`  | `@update:open` (or `v-model:open`) |
  | React / Solid | `onChange` | `onOpenChange`                     |
  | Svelte        | `onchange` | `bind:open`                        |
  | Angular       | `(change)` | `(openChange)` (or `[(open)]`)     |
  | Lit           | `change`   | `open-change`                      |

  On Angular and Lit, `change` collided with the native `change` event that bubbles out of any input inside the panel. Angular `(change)` handlers also received those DOM events, and Lit `change` listeners got plain `Event`s where the type promised `CustomEvent<boolean>`.

  Fixes and additions from the pre-release audit:
  - **Panel id:** the panel id is no longer the fixed `rozie-popover-floating`, which every popover on a page shared. It is `idBase + '-panel'`, with a new `idBase` prop (default `'rozie-popover'`; give each instance its own). The `anchor` slot now also passes `panelId`, so your trigger can set `aria-controls` / `aria-describedby`.
  - **ARIA:** a click popover's anchor wrapper also sets `aria-controls` while open. Hover/focus tooltips no longer claim `aria-haspopup="dialog"` / `aria-expanded`; they keep `aria-describedby`.
  - **Detached reference:** if a referenced Element is removed from the document while open, the popover closes. It used to be positioned against a zero rect at the top-left corner.
  - **Placement changes stick (React):** a change to `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, `disableShift` or `strategy` while open was reverted by the next scroll or resize update on React. Tracking now restarts with the new values on every target.
  - **`matchWidth` and `arrow` reconcile:** toggling them while open now applies. Turning `matchWidth` off clears the width it set, and a zero-width reference (a point virtual element) no longer sets `width: 0px`.
  - **Focus return:** focus now returns to where it was when the popover opened for `manual` popovers too (e.g. with `reference`), and for opens through the handle or a controlled `open`. It is restored only when focus would otherwise be lost (inside the closing panel, or on `<body>`), so clicking into another input no longer pulls focus back to the trigger.
  - **Outside clicks are decided after your handlers:** the click-outside close is decided after the click's own handlers have run, against the `reference` as it is then. A handler that repoints `reference` at the element it was clicked on (keeping `open` true) now moves the panel there on every target. On Angular this used to close the panel while the parent still held `open = true`: the close and the parent's re-open landed in the same tick, and Angular does not re-push an unchanged binding.

- 5abc36f: Add a `popupRole` prop for a popover that hosts a menu (or a listbox, tree or grid), from oinbox dogfooding.
  - **`popupRole`** (`'dialog'` by default, or `'menu'`, `'listbox'`, `'tree'`, `'grid'`; any other value is treated as `'dialog'`) is the `aria-haspopup` a `click` popover's anchor wrapper announces. It was hardcoded to `"dialog"`, so a menu button had to switch to `trigger="manual"` with its own ARIA and lost the click trigger's focus return.
  - **The `anchor` slot passes `popupRole`** alongside `open` and `panelId`, so your own focusable trigger can carry `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`. It is `null` for the tooltip triggers (`'hover'` / `'focus'`), which claim no popup. It is typed `PopoverPopupRole | null`, and the new `PopoverPopupRole` union is exported from every package entry, so it binds straight to `aria-haspopup` under strict React and Solid types.

  Default popovers are unchanged.

- a9d67cb: Typed public surface, phase 1: a component can now declare real TypeScript types for its events, slot parameters and imperative handle, and a consumer on any target sees them instead of `any`. See the new guide, "Typed public surface".

  Four opt-in authoring features (a component that uses none of them compiles exactly as before; all are types-only, with no runtime change on any target):
  - `<types>` block: type-only statements (`import type`, `interface`, `type`, and `export` of those) hoisted into every target and re-exported from the package entry. Anything else is an error (ROZ019, ROZ020). A `<types>` import that clashes with a `<script>` import is ROZ024; an identical duplicate is dropped silently. A `<types>` name that collides with a generated name (`<Name>Props`, `<Name>Handle`, `Rozie<Name>EventMap`, slot context interfaces, …), with a name the compiled module imports (a `<components>` key, its `<Local>Handle`, or a framework / `@rozie/runtime-*` import such as `ReactNode` or `TemplateRef`, reserved on every target), or with a top-level `<script>` declaration is ROZ025.
  - `<emits>` block: `{ name: { payload?: '<type>', docs?: {...} } }`. When present it is the complete list: an undeclared `$emit` is an error (ROZ151), reported at the `$emit` call, and a declared event that is never emitted is a warning (ROZ152), reported at its `<emits>` entry. A `$emit` whose argument count does not match the declared payload is a warning (ROZ157), reported at the call. Invalid entries (including a repeated event name or `payload`/`docs` key), types and docs are ROZ021, ROZ022 and ROZ023. React and Solid get `onX?: (payload: P) => void`, Vue a typed `defineEmits`, Svelte a lowercase `onx` callback, Angular `output<P>()`, and Lit a `CustomEvent<P>` with a generated `Rozie<Name>EventMap` and typed `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` overloads.
  - `<slot :param-types="{ row: 'Row' }">` types a slot parameter (unknown key ROZ153, malformed value ROZ154).
  - `$expose(verbs, signatures)`: a compile-time-only second argument typing the handle (unknown verb ROZ155, malformed ROZ156). The signature strings are stripped from every emitted module. A verb without a signature keeps its implementation's own types when it has them (a return-type annotation or an annotated `const`, in `<script lang="ts">`) on every target; only a fully untyped verb is `(...args: any[]) => any`.

  Also in this release:
  - The component manifest (`rozie-manifest.json`) is schema v2 and carries emit payloads, expose signatures, the `<types>` text and slot `:param-types`. The reader still accepts v1, so composing an already-published v1 package keeps working. Composing a package whose leaves ship a v2 manifest (`@rozie-ui/popover`, `@rozie-ui/combobox`, …) from your own `.rozie` requires `@rozie/*` at or above this release; a compiler that is too old now says so in ROZ988 (upgrade the toolchain) instead of advising a reinstall of the primitive.
  - `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars now carry `<types>` and type slots and events exactly as each compiled module does. Apart from `<types>`, these changes apply to every component, not only to ones that use the new features: Solid `<slot>Slot` props and JSX.Element shapes; Svelte Snippet shapes and lowercase handler names; no spurious `render<X>` props on Vue, Angular and Lit (Lit declares its slot receivers on the element class instead); no `on<X>` props on Lit; and on Angular, every component with events loses its spurious `on<Event>` props, and the declared class gets typed `OutputEmitterRef<T>` outputs from the same derivation as the compiled `output()` fields (`T` is the declared payload, otherwise `void`, or `unknown` when an untyped `$emit` passes a payload). The `<Name>Handle` of an `$expose` component now keeps the type of a verb declared as an annotated `const` (`const add: AddFn = …`) instead of `(...args: any[]) => any` (or the implementation's own signature). A Solid scoped default slot now accepts a function child.
  - Text such as `<script`, `<style`, `<title` or `<textarea` inside a `<types>`, `<emits>`, `<props>`, `<data>`, `<listeners>` or `<components>` body (in a comment, a docs string, or a generic like `Array<Style>`) no longer desynchronises the block splitter. Those bodies are now opaque to the HTML tokenizer.

  Untyped-handler convergence (the one planned typing change for components that do not opt in; the sidecar fixes above reach them too): an untyped event handler is now `(...args: any[]) => void` on every target. The shared `.d.ts` sidecar, Solid and Svelte used to emit `unknown[]`, which rejected handlers written with a concrete parameter type; React already used `any[]`. The generated sources of the Solid and Svelte leaves (and the React `.d.ts`) change accordingly, hence the patch bumps. `@rozie-ui/sortable-list-solid` and `@rozie-ui/switch-solid` also pick up the scoped-default-slot function-child fix.

  `@rozie-ui/popover-*` and `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar-*` adopt the features and are bumped minor, because typed events can reject a previously accepted wrong-typed handler:
  - popover: the `anchor` slot context is typed (including the new `panelId: string`) and the handle (`show`, `hide`, `toggle`, `reposition`) is typed. Its open state's change event is the `open` model's (Lit: `open-change`, now in `RoziePopoverEventMap` as `CustomEvent<boolean>`).
  - fullcalendar: 11 typed events (for example `eventClick` with `jsEvent: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent`, and `unselect` with `jsEvent: UIEvent | null`), 10 typed portal slot arguments and 16 typed handle verbs. The `<types>` names are re-exported from every package entry, and the package barrels re-export the handle types and Lit event maps.
  - Both families generate their README event tables from `<emits>` and no longer ship `scripts/event-manifest.mjs`.

### Patch Changes

- a9d67cb: Props types now accept the root element's HTML attributes when a component passes attributes through to a single root element (typed public surface, phase 3).
  - React: `interface XProps extends Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'<tag>'>, …>` — `className`, `style`, `id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, element-specific attributes (`disabled` on a `<button>` root, …) and DOM listeners typecheck without a cast.
  - Solid: the same with `ComponentProps<'<tag>'>`.
  - Svelte: `interface Props extends Omit<SvelteHTMLElements['<tag>'], …>` replaces `[key: string]: unknown`. **This is stricter:** an attribute the root element does not support, which the old index signature accepted, is now a type error.
  - The component's own props win on a name collision. `children` stays rejected when the component has no default slot, as do the content-replacing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) and `innerHTML` / `innerText` / `textContent` (Solid).
  - An `<svg>` root gets the SVG element's attributes (`fill`, `stroke`, `viewBox`, …). Any other non-HTML root (a custom element) gets the generic `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` on React and Solid, and Svelte's permissive custom-element entry.
  - Components with `inherit-attrs="false"`, an `r-if` root or a component root are unchanged. Vue, Angular and Lit are unchanged; they already accepted pass-through attributes.

  The `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars (React, Solid, Svelte) carry the same types. Types only — no runtime change.

  - @rozie/runtime-react@0.8.0

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 4f2148d: Design-system bridges now yield to a token set on any ancestor, and apply correctly on Lit.

  Each family's `bootstrap`/`material`/`shadcn` theme bridge previously assigned the tokens it
  maps directly on the component's own class. In CSS, a value an element declares for itself
  always beats one it would inherit — so with a bridge imported, a public
  `--rozie-<family>-*` token set on an ancestor (`:root`, `.dark`, a themed wrapper) had no effect;
  only setting it on the component element itself worked. On Lit specifically, where the
  component's class lives inside a shadow root that a document-level bridge selector can never
  match, every bridge was completely inert.

  Every read site that base.css gives a default, or a bridge maps, is now public-token-first, then
  a private wiring name, then the inline default — e.g.
  `var(--rozie-switch-on-bg, var(--rsw-on-bg, #0066cc))` — so a value set on any ancestor always
  wins over a bridge's own mapping, and a public accent set on an ancestor now also recolours the
  bridge-mapped tokens that default to it (ring colour, check colour, etc). Each bridge now
  redeclares only the wiring for the tokens it maps, with the design system's own variable as the
  fallback, resolved on the component itself — so it follows the nearest theme scope rather than
  only ever reading `:root`, and a Lit host in the document's light DOM is matched directly by its
  tag. Zero-import rendering is unchanged in every case: with nothing imported, every chain still
  resolves to the same built-in default it always has.

  **Behaviour changes a consumer can see:** with a bridge imported, a `--rozie-<family>-*` token
  set on any ancestor now wins over the bridge's mapping (previously it only won when set directly
  on the component element). On Lit, the bridges now actually apply (previously inert); a Lit
  component nested inside another shadow root reads the design system's variables at the document
  root.

  **`@rozie-ui/rete`** additionally fixes its dark palette specifically: `FlowCanvas`'s
  OS-dark palette was declared directly on the canvas element (competing with base.css's own
  `.dark`/OS-dark declarations on the same element), so any ancestor override of a
  `--rozie-flow-*` token was dead in OS-dark mode even with nothing else imported. The palette now
  lives at the document root at zero specificity, so an ancestor override reaches it in every mode.

  No component source behaviour changes beyond the CSS cascade described above; this is a pure
  theming/cascade fix in every family listed.
  - @rozie/runtime-react@0.7.5

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Declare `@rozie/runtime-*` as `workspace:^` instead of `workspace:*`.

  `workspace:*` publishes as an **exact** pin on the runtime version, so every toolchain bump forced a republish of every leaf that carried one — 76 of the 92 packages in the previous release wave had no source change at all. `workspace:^` publishes as `^<version>`, which a later patch-level runtime still satisfies, so an unchanged leaf stays valid instead of being dragged along.

  This is not a new policy: it is the caret policy already documented and applied by nine family codegen scripts ("bake the caret policy now so `workspace:*` is normalized to `workspace:^`"). It was simply never applied to the leaves whose codegen does not write `package.json`. The Svelte leaves were already fully aligned; the Vue leaves were aligned apart from three. This brings the React, Solid, Lit, and Angular leaves in line, so all six targets now state the dependency the same way.

  The `@rozie/*` toolchain packages keep `workspace:*` deliberately — they are a changesets `fixed` group and always version in lockstep, so an exact pin is correct there.

  This release still republishes these leaves, because their published `package.json` genuinely changes. The benefit is on every release after it.

### Minor Changes

- f1fd891: Combobox gains multi-select, a floating-positioned popup, and creatable mode; popover gains two opt-in composition primitives; command-palette's combobox peer moves to admit the new minor.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — multi-select via a widened model, not a second one.** A new `multiple: Boolean` prop (default `false`) turns the existing sole `value` model into an array of selected values — there is still only one `model: true` prop, so `[formControl]` / `[(ngModel)]` binding on Angular is unaffected. Re-selecting a selected option toggles it off; selected values render as chips in selection order through a new `#chip` scoped slot (`{ option, remove, index }`); duplicate values dedupe to one chip; a chip whose option later disappears from `options` persists, labelled by its raw value; Backspace on an empty query removes the last chip. `aria-multiselectable="true"` and per-option `aria-selected` are present on the listbox when `multiple` is on. Works across all four render branches (plain, `groups`, `groups`+`groupCap`, `virtual`).

  The `change` event payload gains a `selected` field — the direction of the toggle (`true` when a value was added, `false` when removed or after `clear()`). This is purely additive for existing single-select consumers destructuring `{ value, option }`: `selected` is simply a new property, always `true` for a single-select pick.

  **Consumer-visible DOM change under `multiple`:** selected chips render as a `<ul class="rozie-combobox-chips">` inside the composed popover's anchor content, immediately before the `<input>`, guarded solely on `multiple` — so the chip rail plus the input together become what the floating popup's `matchWidth` measures. Consumer CSS that targets `.rozie-combobox`'s direct children may need attention when opting into `multiple`; the non-`multiple` DOM shape is unchanged.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — floating-positioned popup, composed rather than reimplemented.** The popup is now positioned by Floating UI through the published `@rozie-ui/popover` leaf (a new `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` peer on all six leaves) rather than static CSS: it flips and shifts to stay on screen near a viewport edge. `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, and `disableShift` forward to the composed popover. Under `inline`, a Popover is still mounted — what `inline` switches off is positioning and dismissal, via `disablePositioning` and `disableDismiss`; the list continues to render through the same composed popover as the floating mode.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — creatable mode.** A new `creatable: Boolean` prop (default `false`). When committed text matches no existing option (case-insensitive, trimmed, exact label match), combobox emits a new `create` event with the query string and writes nothing to `value` — the consumer owns adding the option and updating the model. The create affordance renders last, through a new `#create` scoped slot, after all options and group sections. Composes with `multiple`.

  **`@rozie-ui/popover` — five new opt-in, gated capabilities, shipping as a MINOR.** All six leaves land on `0.2.0` in this wave. `bare: Boolean` strips Popover's own positioning wrapper output down to a minimal unstyled surface — for a composing component (like combobox's floating mode) that wants Popover's mount/dismiss lifecycle without its default chrome. `disablePositioning: Boolean` takes the panel out of Floating UI's positioning path entirely, so it participates in ordinary document flow instead of being absolutely positioned — this is what `inline` mode now relies on, and it previously had no release note at all. `keepMounted: Boolean` hides the floating panel instead of unmounting it (a one-shot position on mount, `autoUpdate` still strictly open-gated) — useful for a composed virtualizer whose scroll container must survive close/open. `matchWidth: Boolean` matches the panel's width exactly to its anchor via Floating UI's `size` middleware, width-only. `disableDismiss: Boolean` suppresses Popover's own Escape-key and click-outside dismissal listeners — for a composing component that drives `open` itself and needs to veto Popover's independent dismissal while a host sub-surface anchored to (but not nested inside) the composed control legitimately holds focus. All five default to `false`; existing click/hover/focus, non-`bare`, non-`disablePositioning`, non-`keepMounted`, non-`matchWidth`, non-`disableDismiss` consumers see no behavioral or visual change to the pre-wave 12-prop surface — verified via an additive-only `.d.ts` diff and Docker VR runs with zero unexplained baseline diffs. Three CSS rules were ADDED to support these capabilities (`--static`, `--bare`, `--hidden`); the pre-existing rule set is itself unchanged, but a reader should not infer that no rules were added at all.

  Two caveats existing consumers should know before adopting either capability: **`matchWidth` is not reversible** — there is no `$watch` and no code path that ever clears the inline `style.width` the `size` middleware writes once applied, so a consumer that toggles `matchWidth` off at runtime will see the stale width persist. And **existing `trigger="manual"` consumers DO see an emitted-DOM change**: `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` were unconditional pre-wave and are now gated on a new `hasGestureTrigger()` check (`trigger === 'click' || 'hover' || 'focus'`), so a `trigger="manual"` popover no longer emits those two attributes.

  **`@rozie-ui/command-palette` — combobox peer range widens; the FILES and the COMPONENT tell two different stories.** All six leaves widen their `@rozie-ui/combobox-<target>` peer from `^0.4.0` to `^0.5.0`. A caret range on a 0.x version pins the minor, so the previous range does not admit combobox's incoming `0.5.0` — every leaf moves in this same wave or the published command-palette leaves become uninstallable against the combobox version they actually need.

  **File-truth:** zero source drift. The complete diff across all six `@rozie-ui/command-palette-<target>` leaves is six `package.json` peer lines, independently confirmed by a published-tarball audit showing all six leaves drifting on `package.json:manifest` only.

  **Component-truth:** the rendered component is not unchanged, because it composes combobox and inherits combobox's own popover composition. It now unconditionally mounts a Popover, adding `.rozie-popover-anchor` / `.rozie-popover-floating` wrapper elements to the DOM; it gains an unconditional `queueMicrotask` focus re-assertion routed through combobox's `onFocus` on all six targets; and `pinned` moves from a module-scope `let` to reactive `$data`. `command-palette` itself still uses `inline` (never floats). The command-palette audit traced all three of these and found no defect follows from any of them — noted here so a reader relying on "peer range only" does not miss real, if inert, DOM and behavior changes.

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 6274a5f: React's `useMemo` stabilization of an escaping top-level `const` was discovered by a
  ONE-LEVEL, NON-TRANSITIVE scan of `Listener.deps` / `LifecycleHook.setupDeps` — a
  `new X()` an effect reached only THROUGH a top-level helper (`buildState() ->
gutterCompartment.of(...)`) was invisible to that scan and never got `useMemo`, so React
  rebuilt it fresh every render. For an identity-keyed engine object (a CodeMirror6
  `Compartment`, a Map/WeakMap/Set used as cross-render scratch state) this silently no-ops
  any imperative API keyed on that instance's identity — CodeMirror's
  `scheduleReconfigure(compartment, ...)` against an `EditorState` that never saw the fresh
  Compartment being the corpus shape that surfaced this. All four turbo gates (build, test,
  dist-parity, typecheck) stayed green while the bug was live; only visual regression testing
  caught it.

  `computeEscapingNames` (`packages/targets/react/src/emit/computeEscapingNames.ts`) now runs
  a worklist-to-fixpoint over top-level helper bodies: a helper name reached by an
  effect/listener seed is walked (its body inspected for further references) but never itself
  promoted into the escaping set — only a non-function top-level `const` binder reached at any
  depth through that walk is added. This bound is deliberate: promoting a helper NAME into the
  escaping set would flip a hoisted `function` declaration back into a non-hoisted
  `useCallback` const, reopening the temporal-dead-zone class the emitter's plain-hoist branch
  exists to close, across 860+ shipped `function` declarations corpus-wide. The duplicated seed
  computation (previously maintained independently in two places in `emitScript.ts`) is now
  one shared computation, so the `useMemo`/`useCallback` wrap decision and the seam-3 staleness
  classification can never silently diverge.

  The CodeMirror unwind quick 260829-gbs had to revert (`5d48f9156`, because the two
  `code-mirror [react]` VR cells failed all retries under the pre-fix emitter) is re-landed:
  all six leaves regenerated from the fixed emitter, all ten CM6 `Compartment` instances now
  emit as `useMemo(() => new Compartment(), [])` on React, and the five non-React leaves are
  byte-identical to the original unwind (`61bf99340`) — the emitter fix itself is React-only.

  Four other shipped React leaves carried a const of this exact shape and changed wrap form as
  an expected consequence, each individually inspected (correct empty dep array on a
  non-reactive initializer, no reactive-read case regressed to `[]`, no `.current`-read freeze
  hazard, and zero helper `function` declarations flipped form anywhere in the corpus):
  `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` (`GRID_PAGE_STEP`, `DATA_WRITE_TOKEN_KEY`, `SELECT_COL_ID`,
  `EXPANDER_COL_ID`), `@rozie-ui/rete-react` (`RESIZE_MIN_FALLBACK`, `CONN_WARN_SETTLE_MS`,
  `HISTORY_CAP`, `ZOOM_STEP`), and `@rozie-ui/toast-react` (`EXIT_FAILSAFE_MS`). Every one is a
  bare literal initializer reading nothing, so `[]` is the correct and complete dep array.

  **Emitted-comment fidelity — two structural fixes.** The component-scope emission loop mixes
  statements emitted as hand-built STRINGS (four `tryWrap*` passes) with statements emitted
  through a per-statement `@babel/generator` call, each of the latter carrying its own
  printed-comment dedup set. Because Babel attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements to
  BOTH neighbours at once, a shared comment printed TWICE (both neighbours rendered it) or ZERO
  times (neither did), depending purely on which pass claimed each side — and both failures
  were live in the shipped corpus simultaneously. No per-wrap rule can be right for both sides,
  so the decision moved to a block-wide printed-comment ledger keyed on comment object
  identity, which prints every comment exactly once in source order regardless of which pass
  claims either neighbour. This mirrors the single-dedup-set precedent `genBlockInner` and
  `genImportsBlock` already set for their own scopes.

  Separately, `hoistModuleLet` removed a hoisted `let`'s declaration from the component body
  and took the author's comment on that declaration with it. Those leading comments are now
  re-homed onto the nearest surviving neighbour before removal. This one was invisible from
  inside a single component: an inline host kept such a comment (its neighbour is one parse
  away and carries it as `trailingComments`) while the byte-identical `<script src>`
  partial-inlined host — whose spliced node comes from a DIFFERENT parse with no comments
  attached — lost it. `dist-parity`'s Phase 56-R8 / R11 partial-vs-inline byte-identity cells
  are what caught it.

  Net effect across the shipped React corpus: 2110 comment lines restored, 187 duplicate
  prints removed, and **zero** comments dropped and **zero** non-comment bytes changed —
  verified line-by-line against the pre-change corpus. Fifteen further React leaves are bumped
  here for that comment-fidelity restoration alone, with no code change:
  `@rozie-ui/captcha-react`, `chartjs-react`, `combobox-react`, `command-palette-react`,
  `cropper-react`, `date-picker-react`, `embla-react`, `flatpickr-react`, `otp-react`,
  `pdf-react`, `popover-react`, `sortable-list-react`, `tags-react`, `tiptap-react`, and
  `wavesurfer-react`.

  Nine more React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately OMITTED from
  the front matter: `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package alongside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail
  outright — the exact breakage `8865e96df` repaired, not reintroduced here.

- 4a2de54: React dropped the author's leading comments on any top-level `const f = () => {…}`. The
  emitter rebuilds those as `function f() {…}` so the binding hoists (a real TDZ fix), but it
  returned the bare synthetic node — no source position and no comments attached — so
  `@babel/generator` printed the declaration and silently discarded everything documenting it.
  Measured against the shipped corpus, that was 683 of React's 899 lost comments; Solid, whose
  identically-named `tryHoistArrowToFunction` has always ended with `t.inherits(fn, stmt)`,
  lost none. React simply never got that line.

  Restoring it alone is only half the mechanism, and the half on its own is a regression. A
  comment authored between a hoisted module-`let` and the declaration below it survives on the
  inline path (one parse attaches the comment object to both neighbours, so the successor still
  carries it) but not across a `<script src>` partial boundary, where the spliced successor
  comes from a different parse with nothing attached. There the comment lives only on the
  removed `let`'s trailing side and dies with the statement — so the inline host printed a
  comment the partial-inlined host could not, and the two stopped being byte-identical.

  Quick task 260829-j18 re-homed a removed statement's LEADING comments onto a surviving
  neighbour but deliberately skipped the trailing side, on the reasoning that a removed
  statement's trailing comments are the same objects Babel attached as the next statement's
  leading comments, so that side already had an owner. That holds for an inline-authored
  `<script>` and fails at a splice boundary. `hoistModuleLet` now re-homes the trailing side
  too, onto the nearest following survivor, deduped by comment object IDENTITY — which is what
  keeps the inline case from double-printing, since there the object is already present on the
  successor.

  The two changes ship together and are asserted together: `dist-parity`'s multi-boundary
  "DataTable-shaped permanent guard" goes red with either half missing, and green with both.

  Across the 38 regenerated React leaves this restores **2655 comments, with zero comments
  dropped and zero non-comment bytes changed** — verified by parsing each file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides, rather than by reading the diff. The
  dist-parity fixture rebless was verified the same way (55 comments restored, no code delta).

  One cosmetic wart, not fixed here: in `@rozie-ui/data-table-react` a single restored comment
  prints on the same line as the preceding function's closing brace (`} // …`) instead of
  starting its own line, because it is re-homed as the previous statement's trailing comment.
  The block still reads immediately above the declaration it documents and the AST is
  unaffected. Output prettiness stays a v2 concern.

  Nine further React leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are deliberately absent from
  the front matter — `@rozie-ui/dialog-react`, `lexical-react`, `listbox-react`,
  `maplibre-react`, `number-field-react`, `pagination-react`, `resizable-react`,
  `slider-react` and `switch-react` are all in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and
  listing an ignored package beside a non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Mount-time staleness fix. Values read inside `$onMount` are now mirrored through synced refs, so a callback registered once at mount no longer reads the first render's values for the lifetime of the component. A consumer that changes a prop — or passes a new handler identity — after mount is now observed by the mount-registered callback instead of being silently ignored.

  Two read kinds landed here:
  - **Prop read** — `disabled`. Disabling the popover after mount is now observed by the mount-registered tracking setup instead of being pinned to the first render's value.
  - **Helper call** — `startTracking()`, so Floating UI tracking starts against current anchor/placement state.

- No `$emit` handler prop was affected. No API surface change.
- @rozie/runtime-react@0.2.3

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.1`. The public `.d.ts` no longer types `toggle`/`show`/`hide` (on `renderAnchor`) as `unknown` — all three resolve to top-level script functions and now type callable (`(...args: any[]) => any`), reversing the 0.3.0 regression that broke the documented `renderAnchor={({ toggle }) => <button onClick={toggle}>…</button>}` quick-start pattern under strict TS. No runtime behavior change; type surface only.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. Declared emit handlers were also landing in the root DOM fallthrough spread and firing twice per emit — the emitter now keeps them out of it. The public `.d.ts` no longer types unresolved `r-for` slot-context params as callable (`() => void`) — they're now `unknown`, matching what the runtime actually hands the caller. No API surface change.
