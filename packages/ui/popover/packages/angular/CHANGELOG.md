### Minor Changes

- f1fd891: Combobox gains multi-select, a floating-positioned popup, and creatable mode; popover gains two opt-in composition primitives; command-palette's combobox peer moves to admit the new minor.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — multi-select via a widened model, not a second one.** A new `multiple: Boolean` prop (default `false`) turns the existing sole `value` model into an array of selected values — there is still only one `model: true` prop, so `[formControl]` / `[(ngModel)]` binding on Angular is unaffected. Re-selecting a selected option toggles it off; selected values render as chips in selection order through a new `#chip` scoped slot (`{ option, remove, index }`); duplicate values dedupe to one chip; a chip whose option later disappears from `options` persists, labelled by its raw value; Backspace on an empty query removes the last chip. `aria-multiselectable="true"` and per-option `aria-selected` are present on the listbox when `multiple` is on. Works across all four render branches (plain, `groups`, `groups`+`groupCap`, `virtual`).

  The `change` event payload gains a `selected` field — the direction of the toggle (`true` when a value was added, `false` when removed or after `clear()`). This is purely additive for existing single-select consumers destructuring `{ value, option }`: `selected` is simply a new property, always `true` for a single-select pick.

  **Consumer-visible DOM change under `multiple`:** selected chips render as a `<ul class="rozie-combobox-chips">` inside the composed popover's anchor content, immediately before the `<input>`, guarded solely on `multiple` — so the chip rail plus the input together become what the floating popup's `matchWidth` measures. Consumer CSS that targets `.rozie-combobox`'s direct children may need attention when opting into `multiple`; the non-`multiple` DOM shape is unchanged.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — floating-positioned popup, composed rather than reimplemented.** The popup is now positioned by Floating UI through the published `@rozie-ui/popover` leaf (a new `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` peer on all six leaves) rather than static CSS: it flips and shifts to stay on screen near a viewport edge. `placement`, `offset`, `disableFlip`, and `disableShift` forward to the composed popover. Under `inline`, a Popover is still mounted — what `inline` switches off is positioning and dismissal, via `disablePositioning` and `disableDismiss`; the list continues to render through the same composed popover as the floating mode.

  **`@rozie-ui/combobox` — creatable mode.** A new `creatable: Boolean` prop (default `false`). When committed text matches no existing option (case-insensitive, trimmed, exact label match), combobox emits a new `create` event with the query string and writes nothing to `value` — the consumer owns adding the option and updating the model. The create affordance renders last, through a new `#create` scoped slot, after all options and group sections. Composes with `multiple`.

  **`@rozie-ui/popover` — five new opt-in, gated capabilities, shipping as a MINOR.** All six leaves land on `0.2.0` in this wave. `bare: Boolean` strips Popover's own positioning wrapper output down to a minimal unstyled surface — for a composing component (like combobox's floating mode) that wants Popover's mount/dismiss lifecycle without its default chrome. `disablePositioning: Boolean` takes the panel out of Floating UI's positioning path entirely, so it participates in ordinary document flow instead of being absolutely positioned — this is what `inline` mode now relies on, and it previously had no release note at all. `keepMounted: Boolean` hides the floating panel instead of unmounting it (a one-shot position on mount, `autoUpdate` still strictly open-gated) — useful for a composed virtualizer whose scroll container must survive close/open. `matchWidth: Boolean` matches the panel's width exactly to its anchor via Floating UI's `size` middleware, width-only. `disableDismiss: Boolean` suppresses Popover's own Escape-key and click-outside dismissal listeners — for a composing component that drives `open` itself and needs to veto Popover's independent dismissal while a host sub-surface anchored to (but not nested inside) the composed control legitimately holds focus. All five default to `false`; existing click/hover/focus, non-`bare`, non-`disablePositioning`, non-`keepMounted`, non-`matchWidth`, non-`disableDismiss` consumers see no behavioral or visual change to the pre-wave 12-prop surface — verified via an additive-only `.d.ts` diff and Docker VR runs with zero unexplained baseline diffs. Three CSS rules were ADDED to support these capabilities (`--static`, `--bare`, `--hidden`); the pre-existing rule set is itself unchanged, but a reader should not infer that no rules were added at all.

  Two caveats existing consumers should know before adopting either capability: **`matchWidth` is not reversible** — there is no `$watch` and no code path that ever clears the inline `style.width` the `size` middleware writes once applied, so a consumer that toggles `matchWidth` off at runtime will see the stale width persist. And **existing `trigger="manual"` consumers DO see an emitted-DOM change**: `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` were unconditional pre-wave and are now gated on a new `hasGestureTrigger()` check (`trigger === 'click' || 'hover' || 'focus'`), so a `trigger="manual"` popover no longer emits those two attributes.

  **`@rozie-ui/command-palette` — combobox peer range widens; the FILES and the COMPONENT tell two different stories.** All six leaves widen their `@rozie-ui/combobox-<target>` peer from `^0.4.0` to `^0.5.0`. A caret range on a 0.x version pins the minor, so the previous range does not admit combobox's incoming `0.5.0` — every leaf moves in this same wave or the published command-palette leaves become uninstallable against the combobox version they actually need.

  **File-truth:** zero source drift. The complete diff across all six `@rozie-ui/command-palette-<target>` leaves is six `package.json` peer lines, independently confirmed by a published-tarball audit showing all six leaves drifting on `package.json:manifest` only.

  **Component-truth:** the rendered component is not unchanged, because it composes combobox and inherits combobox's own popover composition. It now unconditionally mounts a Popover, adding `.rozie-popover-anchor` / `.rozie-popover-floating` wrapper elements to the DOM; it gains an unconditional `queueMicrotask` focus re-assertion routed through combobox's `onFocus` on all six targets; and `pinned` moves from a module-scope `let` to reactive `$data`. `command-palette` itself still uses `inline` (never floats). The command-palette audit traced all three of these and found no defect follows from any of them — noted here so a reader relying on "peer range only" does not miss real, if inert, DOM and behavior changes.

### Patch Changes

- @rozie/runtime-angular@0.7.1

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 6943820: Lit and Angular dropped every leading comment on a top-level declaration promoted into
  the component class — 1370 apiece across the shipped corpus. Both emitters build each
  class member as a hand-built string (`generate(decl)` / `renderExpression` / a rebuilt
  arrow or `t.classMethod`), and none of those carries the STATEMENT's own comments, so an
  author's documentation simply vanished from the emitted component.

  Both now run a printed-comment ledger keyed on comment OBJECT IDENTITY. Identity rather
  than source offsets is load-bearing: a `.rzts` script partial is parsed as its own file,
  so its comment offsets collide with unrelated host comments. A per-branch rule cannot
  work here at all, because @babel/parser attaches a comment sitting BETWEEN two statements
  to BOTH neighbours at once — whichever side a local rule picks, the other side either
  double-prints it or drops it.

  Three properties this needed, each found by measuring the corpus rather than by reading
  code:

  **It looks back, not just down.** Each statement claims the PREVIOUS statement's
  still-unclaimed trailing comments as well as its own leading ones, rendering both above
  its member. Inline, one parse hands the same comment object to both sides, so it prints
  once. Across a `.rzts` splice boundary the successor comes from a different parse with
  nothing attached, and the previous statement's trailing side is the only place the
  comment exists. Without this the inline host printed a comment the partial-inlined host
  could not, and the partial-vs-inline byte-identity guards went red.

  **The ledger spans the import block.** A comment between the last import and the first
  promoted declaration is printed by the module-scope import generation — a separate
  printer with its own dedup set. Unseeded, 132 comments printed twice on Lit and 155 on
  Angular. Seeding from every comment merely ATTACHED to an import node over-corrected and
  lost 16, since a comment can hang off a node the block never prints; the seed is taken
  from what the block actually emitted.

  **It unclaims.** A statement can be consumed by another pass — a `$computed`, a lifecycle
  hook, a `$provide` directive — and produce no class member at all. When the flush finds
  no target it releases the claim so whichever printer does emit that statement still
  renders its comments. Claiming without emitting is how a ledger silently drops comments,
  which is strictly worse than double-printing, and this is why both targets report zero
  lost despite several statement kinds never reaching a ledger-owned array.

  Net effect: 5311 comments restored across 53 Lit leaves and 5266 across the Angular
  leaves, with ZERO comments dropped and ZERO non-comment bytes changed, plus 16
  pre-existing double-prints fixed on each target (a comment that had been emitted both at
  module scope and again inside the mount hook). Verified by parsing every file before and
  after, comparing the parser's own comment list as a multiset, and comparing
  `generate(ast, { comments: false })` on both sides — never by reading the diff.

  Emitted code is unchanged in every case; this is documentation fidelity only.

  Eighteen further Lit/Angular leaves drifted the same comment-only way but are
  deliberately absent from the front matter — dialog, lexical, listbox, maplibre,
  number-field, pagination, resizable, slider and switch (both targets) are all in
  `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list, and listing an ignored package beside a
  non-ignored one makes `changeset status` fail outright.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- f3266db: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken`
  alongside the existing `RozieSlot` marker directive. The Angular target used to
  inline a copy of these three helpers (and, for `rozieToken`, its
  `globalThis`-backed cross-package registry) as module-scope declarations in
  _every_ emitted component that wrapped an interpolation or used the
  `$provide`/`$inject` context primitive — duplicating the same ~40 lines across 21
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaves. The emitter now imports the helpers from
  `@rozie/runtime-angular` instead.

  Behavior is unchanged: the delegating `rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr` class methods
  Angular templates call are untouched, `rozieToken`'s `globalThis`-backed identity
  guarantee is preserved verbatim, and a component using none of the three continues
  to carry no reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` at all. `number-field` and `otp`
  (previously the only two Angular leaves with no existing `@rozie/runtime-angular`
  dependency) now declare it in both `package.json` and `ng-package.json`'s
  `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.

- 78d5b5b: `@rozie/runtime-angular` now exports `createRozieAttrApplier` and
  `createRozieHostAttrsReader` alongside the existing `RozieSlot`,
  `rozieDisplay`, `rozieAttr`, and `rozieToken` exports. The Angular target
  used to inline a copy of the `r-bind`/`$attrs` spread attribute applier and
  host-attribute reader (~85 lines: three `WeakMap` prev-state caches, the
  class/style merge logic, and the host-attribute fold) as a private-field
  IIFE pair in _every_ emitted component that used `r-bind` spread or read
  `$attrs` — 158 tracked emitted files, of which 23 are shipped
  `@rozie-ui/*-angular` leaf sources across 21 leaves.

  The emitted component keeps performing both `inject(Renderer2)` /
  `inject(ElementRef)` calls itself, in the same class-field initializer
  position; it now passes the resolved instance into the runtime factory
  (`createRozieAttrApplier(inject(Renderer2))`) instead of resolving it
  internally. Neither factory ever calls `inject()` or names an Angular
  type — both accept a structural interface (`RozieAttrRenderer`,
  `RozieHostRef`) — so this package still never resolves an Angular DI token
  itself, and the peer-keyed cross-package instance-identity hazard
  (`71dff1d5`) is structurally unreachable rather than merely tested against.

  Merge semantics, applied DOM output, and evaluation order are unchanged: a
  wrapper's own static `class` survives a spread that also sets `class`; a
  dropped `class`/`style` key removes only the tokens/properties this applier
  previously applied; an applied style still lands with `!important` priority,
  winning the last-write race against Angular's own `[ngClass]`/`ɵɵstyleMap`
  re-apply.

  A component using neither `r-bind` spread nor `$attrs` carries no new
  reference to `@rozie/runtime-angular` — the import gate is keyed on whether
  the emitter actually pushed the corresponding field declaration, independent
  of the two Tier-1 gates (`rozieDisplay`/`rozieAttr`/`rozieToken`,
  `RozieSlot`).
