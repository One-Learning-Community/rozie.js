## 0.1.14

### Patch Changes

- a9d67cb: Typed public surface, phase 1: a component can now declare real TypeScript types for its events, slot parameters and imperative handle, and a consumer on any target sees them instead of `any`. See the new guide, "Typed public surface".

  Four opt-in authoring features (a component that uses none of them compiles exactly as before; all are types-only, with no runtime change on any target):
  - `<types>` block: type-only statements (`import type`, `interface`, `type`, and `export` of those) hoisted into every target and re-exported from the package entry. Anything else is an error (ROZ019, ROZ020). A `<types>` import that clashes with a `<script>` import is ROZ024; an identical duplicate is dropped silently. A `<types>` name that collides with a generated name (`<Name>Props`, `<Name>Handle`, `Rozie<Name>EventMap`, slot context interfaces, …), with a name the compiled module imports (a `<components>` key, its `<Local>Handle`, or a framework / `@rozie/runtime-*` import such as `ReactNode` or `TemplateRef`, reserved on every target), or with a top-level `<script>` declaration is ROZ025.
  - `<emits>` block: `{ name: { payload?: '<type>', docs?: {...} } }`. When present it is the complete list: an undeclared `$emit` is an error (ROZ151), reported at the `$emit` call, and a declared event that is never emitted is a warning (ROZ152), reported at its `<emits>` entry. A `$emit` whose argument count does not match the declared payload is a warning (ROZ157), reported at the call. Invalid entries (including a repeated event name or `payload`/`docs` key), types and docs are ROZ021, ROZ022 and ROZ023. React and Solid get `onX?: (payload: P) => void`, Vue a typed `defineEmits`, Svelte a lowercase `onx` callback, Angular `output<P>()`, and Lit a `CustomEvent<P>` with a generated `Rozie<Name>EventMap` and typed `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` overloads.
  - `<slot :param-types="{ row: 'Row' }">` types a slot parameter (unknown key ROZ153, malformed value ROZ154).
  - `$expose(verbs, signatures)`: a compile-time-only second argument typing the handle (unknown verb ROZ155, malformed ROZ156). The signature strings are stripped from every emitted module. A verb without a signature keeps its implementation's own types when it has them (a return-type annotation or an annotated `const`, in `<script lang="ts">`) on every target; only a fully untyped verb is `(...args: any[]) => any`.

  Also in this release:
  - The component manifest (`rozie-manifest.json`) is schema v2 and carries emit payloads, expose signatures, the `<types>` text and slot `:param-types`. The reader still accepts v1, so composing an already-published v1 package keeps working. Composing a package whose leaves ship a v2 manifest (`@rozie-ui/popover`, `@rozie-ui/combobox`, …) from your own `.rozie` requires `@rozie/*` at or above this release; a compiler that is too old now says so in ROZ988 (upgrade the toolchain) instead of advising a reinstall of the primitive.
  - `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars now carry `<types>` and type slots and events exactly as each compiled module does. Apart from `<types>`, these changes apply to every component, not only to ones that use the new features: Solid `<slot>Slot` props and JSX.Element shapes; Svelte Snippet shapes and lowercase handler names; no spurious `render<X>` props on Vue, Angular and Lit (Lit declares its slot receivers on the element class instead); no `on<X>` props on Lit; and on Angular, every component with events loses its spurious `on<Event>` props, and the declared class gets typed `OutputEmitterRef<T>` outputs from the same derivation as the compiled `output()` fields (`T` is the declared payload, otherwise `void`, or `unknown` when an untyped `$emit` passes a payload). The `<Name>Handle` of an `$expose` component now keeps the type of a verb declared as an annotated `const` (`const add: AddFn = …`) instead of `(...args: any[]) => any` (or the implementation's own signature). A Solid scoped default slot now accepts a function child.
  - Text such as `<script`, `<style`, `<title` or `<textarea` inside a `<types>`, `<emits>`, `<props>`, `<data>`, `<listeners>` or `<components>` body (in a comment, a docs string, or a generic like `Array<Style>`) no longer desynchronises the block splitter. Those bodies are now opaque to the HTML tokenizer.

  Untyped-handler convergence (the one planned typing change for components that do not opt in; the sidecar fixes above reach them too): an untyped event handler is now `(...args: any[]) => void` on every target. The shared `.d.ts` sidecar, Solid and Svelte used to emit `unknown[]`, which rejected handlers written with a concrete parameter type; React already used `any[]`. The generated sources of the Solid and Svelte leaves (and the React `.d.ts`) change accordingly, hence the patch bumps. `@rozie-ui/sortable-list-solid` and `@rozie-ui/switch-solid` also pick up the scoped-default-slot function-child fix.

  `@rozie-ui/popover-*` and `@rozie-ui/fullcalendar-*` adopt the features and are bumped minor, because typed events can reject a previously accepted wrong-typed handler:
  - popover: the `anchor` slot context is typed (including the new `panelId: string`) and the handle (`show`, `hide`, `toggle`, `reposition`) is typed. Its open state's change event is the `open` model's (Lit: `open-change`, now in `RoziePopoverEventMap` as `CustomEvent<boolean>`).
  - fullcalendar: 11 typed events (for example `eventClick` with `jsEvent: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent`, and `unselect` with `jsEvent: UIEvent | null`), 10 typed portal slot arguments and 16 typed handle verbs. The `<types>` names are re-exported from every package entry, and the package barrels re-export the handle types and Lit event maps.
  - Both families generate their README event tables from `<emits>` and no longer ship `scripts/event-manifest.mjs`.

- a9d67cb: Props types now accept the root element's HTML attributes when a component passes attributes through to a single root element (typed public surface, phase 3).
  - React: `interface XProps extends Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'<tag>'>, …>` — `className`, `style`, `id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, element-specific attributes (`disabled` on a `<button>` root, …) and DOM listeners typecheck without a cast.
  - Solid: the same with `ComponentProps<'<tag>'>`.
  - Svelte: `interface Props extends Omit<SvelteHTMLElements['<tag>'], …>` replaces `[key: string]: unknown`. **This is stricter:** an attribute the root element does not support, which the old index signature accepted, is now a type error.
  - The component's own props win on a name collision. `children` stays rejected when the component has no default slot, as do the content-replacing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) and `innerHTML` / `innerText` / `textContent` (Solid).
  - An `<svg>` root gets the SVG element's attributes (`fill`, `stroke`, `viewBox`, …). Any other non-HTML root (a custom element) gets the generic `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` on React and Solid, and Svelte's permissive custom-element entry.
  - Components with `inherit-attrs="false"`, an `r-if` root or a component root are unchanged. Vue, Angular and Lit are unchanged; they already accepted pass-through attributes.

  The `.d.rozie.ts` sidecars (React, Solid, Svelte) carry the same types. Types only — no runtime change.
  - @rozie/runtime-solid@0.8.0

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- 308d24b: Fixed: repeated PageUp/PageDown could permanently drop keyboard focus out of the calendar grid onto the page body, most reproducibly on Angular (measured ~1-in-5 presses) but latent on every target.

  Two independent bugs combined to cause this:
  1. Landing the new focus position after a month swing was a single fixed-frame guess (wait one animation frame, then commit). On slower/loaded renders the framework hadn't yet committed the new month's day cells by then, and once that one guess missed, nothing ever retried — focus was lost for good. This is now outcome-keyed: it polls (bounded to 10 frames, matching the same pattern already used for data-table's virtualization) until the DOM actually shows the new month before committing the new focus target.
  2. A second PageUp/PageDown pressed before the first press's landing had finished starting a second, independent landing sequence — the two could interleave and the older one could win with stale data. The newer press now cancels any still-in-flight landing from a previous press before starting its own.

  No public API changes.

- 28a8599: Design-system bridges now yield to a token set on any ancestor, and apply correctly on Lit.

  Each family's `bootstrap`/`material`/`shadcn` theme bridge previously assigned the tokens it
  maps directly on the component's own class. In CSS, a value an element declares for itself
  always beats one it would inherit — so with a bridge imported, a public
  `--rozie-<family>-*` token set on an ancestor (`:root`, `.dark`, a themed wrapper) had no effect;
  only setting it on the component element itself worked. On Lit specifically, where the
  component's class lives inside a shadow root that a document-level bridge selector can never
  match, every bridge was completely inert.

  Every read site that base.css gives a default, or a bridge maps, is now public-token-first, then
  a private wiring name, then the inline default — e.g.
  `var(--rozie-switch-on-bg, var(--rsw-on-bg, #0066cc))` — so a value set on any ancestor always
  wins over a bridge's own mapping, and a public accent set on an ancestor now also recolours the
  bridge-mapped tokens that default to it (ring colour, check colour, etc). Each bridge now
  redeclares only the wiring for the tokens it maps, with the design system's own variable as the
  fallback, resolved on the component itself — so it follows the nearest theme scope rather than
  only ever reading `:root`, and a Lit host in the document's light DOM is matched directly by its
  tag. Zero-import rendering is unchanged in every case: with nothing imported, every chain still
  resolves to the same built-in default it always has.

  **Behaviour changes a consumer can see:** with a bridge imported, a `--rozie-<family>-*` token
  set on any ancestor now wins over the bridge's mapping (previously it only won when set directly
  on the component element). On Lit, the bridges now actually apply (previously inert); a Lit
  component nested inside another shadow root reads the design system's variables at the document
  root.

  **`@rozie-ui/rete`** additionally fixes its dark palette specifically: `FlowCanvas`'s
  OS-dark palette was declared directly on the canvas element (competing with base.css's own
  `.dark`/OS-dark declarations on the same element), so any ancestor override of a
  `--rozie-flow-*` token was dead in OS-dark mode even with nothing else imported. The palette now
  lives at the document root at zero specificity, so an ancestor override reaches it in every mode.

  No component source behaviour changes beyond the CSS cascade described above; this is a pure
  theming/cascade fix in every family listed.

- 28a8599: Updated dependencies: `@rozie/runtime-solid@0.7.5`.
- 28a8599: Fixed: the `themes/*.css` design-token bridge files' example `import` line named the wrong package (`@rozie-ui/<family>-react`) on every non-React target — copied byte-for-byte from one canonical source. It now names `@rozie-ui/date-picker-solid`, this package's own.
- 28a8599: **Fixed: published Solid leaves now ship compiled JavaScript for `import`/`require`, with JSX
  kept only under the `solid` export condition.**

  Every `@rozie-ui/*-solid` leaf with markup previously shipped Solid JSX inside
  `dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` under a plain `import`/`require` (`chartjs-solid` renders no markup of its
  own, but ships the same corrected export shape for consistency with its siblings). That is not
  valid JavaScript on its own — a default `vite-plugin-solid` setup
  fails with "JSX syntax is disabled" (the plugin only transforms `.[mc]?[jt]sx` files), and any
  bundler without a Solid plugin fails outright. The only way to consume these packages was to
  manually point `vite-plugin-solid` at the package's `.mjs` files inside `node_modules` — a
  workaround, not a supported shape.

  New export shape (the standard one for a published Solid library):
  - `import` / `require` → `dist/<entry>.{mjs,cjs}`, compiled to plain DOM output by
    `babel-preset-solid`. Any bundler consumes this with no Solid plugin at all.
  - `solid` (export condition) → `dist/source/<entry>.jsx`, JSX kept intact. `vite-plugin-solid`
    and SolidStart resolve this condition first and compile it themselves for their own mode (DOM /
    SSR / hydration).

  **If you were using the `extensions: ['.mjs']` / `node_modules` `include` workaround with
  `vite-plugin-solid` to consume one of these packages, remove it — it is no longer needed** and a
  default `vite-plugin-solid` setup now resolves the `solid` condition correctly on its own. No
  public API change on any of these leaves.

## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- b084200: Solid: slot scope values are now passed as lazy getters instead of eager reads.

  A scoped slot invocation used to build its param object as `{ open: open() }`. Because that object is constructed inside the JSX insert that invokes the slot, Solid subscribed the **insert itself** to every signal read while building it — so any change re-ran the insert, re-invoked the consumer's slot function, and replaced the rendered subtree. Emitting `{ get open() { return open(); } }` defers the read into the consumer's own reactive scope, which is Solid's own convention for passing reactive props.

  Observable fix: opening the data-table column menu no longer tears the just-focused trigger out of the DOM, so the documented "Escape returns focus to the trigger" guarantee now holds on Solid as it already did on the other five targets.

  Literals and function-valued expressions are deliberately left as plain properties — neither can read a signal, and wrapping a function would hand the consumer a new identity on every property access.

  Note for consumers: destructuring a slot scope (`({ option, index }) => …`) and spreading it behave exactly as before. The one behavior change is that **assigning** to a scope property now throws `TypeError: Cannot set property x of #<Object> which has only a getter`, where it previously succeeded silently. Writing to a slot scope was never a supported pattern.

  `@rozie/core` is named here even though no file under `packages/core/` changed: the emitter lives in the private `@rozie/target-solid` package, which is bundled into core's published dist (and into `unplugin`, `babel-plugin`, and `cli`). A changeset derived from changed paths alone would ship a toolchain that still emits the bug.

### Patch Changes

- Docs-only, no runtime change. The `rangeComplete` event's shared per-target
  casing description (rendered into every target's README Events table) is
  corrected to state the Lit target's ACTUAL behavior — `range-complete`,
  kebab-cased at dispatch — instead of the stale "CASE-PRESERVED" claim fixed
  in `@rozie-ui/date-picker-lit`'s patch release in this same wave. Because the
  description is a single shared string sourced from one manifest entry and
  rendered into every target's README, correcting it for Lit accuracy also
  updates the sentence in this target's README even though this target's own
  runtime behavior is unchanged — bumped to keep the published tarball in sync
  with source.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- `@rozie/runtime-lit` gains a new public export, `RozieSlotDistributor` — a reactive
  controller that performs manual slot assignment for a Lit shadow root, used wherever a
  component needs to route projected children into loop-generated `<slot>` targets
  (e.g. carousel slides). Adopting manual `slotAssignment` turns OFF the browser's
  automatic Text-node projection for that shadow root: raw text children must now be
  assigned to a slot explicitly, and any code reading `assignedNodes()` needs to guard
  for the manual-assignment case. A host that adopts the controller needs its
  `shadowRootOptions` typed as `ShadowRootInit`.

  `@rozie/core` adds two new compile-time diagnostics and one new template sigil:
  - **ROZ148** — flags a prop whose name collides with an emitted callback name, before
    it becomes a runtime shadowing bug on a target that lowers the prop to a method.
  - **ROZ210** — flags a reserved slot name so it can't silently collide with an
    internally-generated one.
  - **`$slotted`** — a new member sigil authors can read inside a loop to get the live,
    reactively-assigned elements projected into that iteration's slot.

  `@rozie/{cli,unplugin,babel-plugin}` bundle `@rozie/core`'s compiler, so this release
  carries the same diagnostics and `$slotted` lowering through to every consumer of
  those packages — the compiler itself moved even though none of these three changed
  their own source. `$slotted` lowers to a reactive assigned-elements signal on the Lit
  target (backed by `RozieSlotDistributor`, gated behind a new `shouldDistributeSlots`
  check so it only emits where a loop actually needs manual slot assignment) and to a
  plain `[]` on the five hostless targets (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular), where
  there's no shadow root to distribute into.

  `@rozie/runtime-{react,vue,svelte,solid,keynav-core}` are version-aligned to 0.5.0 by
  the changesets `fixed` group riding the `runtime-lit` minor above — this is a
  version-alignment release only; none of these five packages has a source or behavior
  change in this wave.

  `@rozie-ui/date-picker-*` (all six targets) — day and caption labels are now derived
  from `Intl`, with a new `labels` prop for overriding them; range-span selections now
  validate against `disabled` dates; and the calendar header adds drill-in/drill-out
  navigation verbs.

  `@rozie-ui/embla-*` (all six targets) adopts `$slotted` for its carousel slides. On
  the Lit target specifically, this closes a real projection gap: raw `slot="slide"`
  children are now distributed per-iteration instead of only the first iteration
  claiming them.

  `@rozie-ui/{combobox,command-palette,data-table,sortable-list,tags,toast}-lit` are
  regenerated against the new Lit emitter output above — each already used a loop-slot
  pattern that now runs through `RozieSlotDistributor` / `$slotted` instead of the prior
  ad hoc approach, with no observable behavior change for existing consumers of these
  specific leaves.

- Updated dependencies
  - @rozie/runtime-solid@0.5.0

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against the `r-keynav` strict-containment focus guard (`@rozie/runtime-solid@0.4.0`). The day/months/years grids no longer steal DOM focus on a cold page load or while focus sits on an unrelated element elsewhere on the page; drilling into the months/years panels and exiting back out with Escape now reliably restores keyboard focus to the previously-selected day. Arrow-key navigation and click selection are unaffected. No API surface change.
- @rozie/runtime-solid@0.4.0

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Regenerated against `@rozie/core@0.3.0`. The `splitProps` skip-list now correctly excludes emit-handler props from the root DOM fallthrough spread — previously a consumer's handler fired twice per emit. No API surface change.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- First published release. `0.1.2` is the FIRST all-targets `@rozie-ui/date-picker` release line — all six leaves (react / vue / solid / lit / svelte / angular) aligned at the same version. The earlier `0.1.0`/`0.1.1` numbers were never published; they are changesets ripples from `@rozie/runtime-*` bumps.

  **Keyboard/accessibility hardening** (included in this first publish):
  - Disabled day cells are now focusable-but-inert per the ARIA grid pattern — the native `disabled` attribute moved off individual day buttons (kept only for whole-control `disabled`), with `aria-disabled="true"` carrying the state. Arrow keys traverse past disabled days instead of dead-ending, and Enter on one is a no-op. CSS hook changed from `.rozie-datepicker-day:disabled` to `[aria-disabled='true']` — identical declarations, pixel-identical output, but consumers who overrode the `:disabled` selector must update. **This is the only consumer-visible break in this release.**
  - Roving-tabindex fallback fixed — the grid always exposes exactly one day tab stop, falling back anchor-in-view → today-in-view → first-enabled, so tabbing into the calendar still works after the selected day scrolls out of view.
  - Drill focus continuity — entering/leaving the months and years views keeps keyboard focus inside the control instead of dropping to `<body>`.
  - Multi-month `Home`/`End` now resolve against the panel the focused day actually lives in (previously scanned month 0 only).

  Also includes documentation corrections (footer slot, range-mode `clear()`, 5 previously undocumented props, corrected React/Solid slot examples) — documentation only, no API change.
