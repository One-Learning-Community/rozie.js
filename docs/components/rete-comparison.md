# Node-flow editor libraries comparison

How `@rozie-ui/rete` (`FlowCanvas`) compares to the existing per-framework node-flow / graph editor libraries. A node editor's hard parts — the graph model, viewport pan/zoom, node drag, and drag-to-connect — are inherently framework-agnostic; [Rete.js v2](https://retejs.org/) is the engine that owns all of them and delegates only *rendering* to a swappable layer. The per-framework editors each re-solve those hard parts from scratch, which is why the ecosystem is **siloed**: React and Svelte are well-served, Vue has a separate reimplementation, Angular has a couple of options, and **Solid has only an experiment while Lit has nothing**. Rozie ships one source to all six by wrapping the agnostic engine with a single vanilla render layer.

## The libraries at a glance

| Library | Package | Frameworks | Rendering | State model | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **React Flow** | `@xyflow/react` | **React only** | SVG edges + DOM nodes | internal Zustand store | mature, deep — the category leader on React |
| **Svelte Flow** | `@xyflow/svelte` | **Svelte only** | SVG + DOM | Svelte 5 runes | mature; shares `@xyflow/system` core with React Flow |
| **Vue Flow** | `@vue-flow/core` | **Vue only** | SVG + DOM | own Vue store | mature, but a **separate** codebase — not xyflow's shared core |
| **Foblex Flow** | `@foblex/flow` | **Angular only** | DOM + SVG | Angular signals | active; Angular-only |
| **ngx-graph** | `@swimlane/ngx-graph` | **Angular only** | SVG (D3 + dagre) | RxJS | graph-viz-first, less an interactive editor |
| **solid-flow** | `solid-flow` | Solid | SVG + DOM | signals | **single-author experiment**, not production-grade |
| **Lit** | — | — | — | — | **no standalone library exists** |
| **Rozie** | `@rozie-ui/rete-*` | **all 6** | DOM + SVG (vanilla render layer) | Rete `NodeEditor` (the engine owns it) | one source → React/Vue/Svelte/Angular/Solid/Lit |

The big-framework editors above are **excellent, mature libraries** — for a single-React app, React Flow is the obvious pick, and Rozie does not claim to out-feature it on its home framework. The wedge is breadth: **no single library ships all six**, and two targets are essentially unserved. xyflow — the strongest brand — publishes only `@xyflow/react` and `@xyflow/svelte` (its shared `@xyflow/system` core has **no** Vue/Solid/Angular/Lit wrapper); Vue Flow is a wholly separate project; **Solid** has only a single-author `solid-flow` experiment; and **Lit / web-components has nothing at all**. The one ecosystem that even approaches breadth is **Rete.js**, whose render plugins cover React/Vue/Angular/Svelte/Lit — five divergent codebases, and still no Solid. Rozie replaces those five plugins with **one `.rozie` source and one vanilla render layer**, and adds the missing Solid (and a far thinner Lit) for free.

## Why wrap Rete.js

A Rete render plugin's only job is to (a) fill each engine-created node element with DOM, (b) draw each connection's SVG path, and (c) tell the connection plugin where the sockets are. The official plugins do (a)+(b) with a framework's component tree — that *is* the per-framework coupling. `FlowCanvas` does all three with a **vanilla render pipe** (`area.addPipe`), emitting `render` socket signals the `ConnectionPlugin` + `getDOMSocketPosition` watcher consume, and drawing connection paths with `classicConnectionPath`. The engine (`NodeEditor` + `AreaPlugin` + `ConnectionPlugin`) owns graph state and all pointer interaction; the Rozie component is a thin view over it, so the same source behaves identically on every target.

## Where Rozie wins today

- **One definition, six idiomatic packages** — including the two frameworks the ecosystem leaves out entirely: **Solid** (only a single-author experiment) and **Lit** (nothing). Those consumers get a real node editor they otherwise cannot have, from the same source that produces the four big-framework packages.
- **A controlled-graph authoring model on all six** — the consumer binds **one `r-model:graph` object** and declares a couple of **`<NodeType type>` templates** (each with a `#body` and a typed `<Port>` schema); the canvas renders every node by its type and **writes layout + connections back** into the bound object, so there is no hand-reconciling. It is the xyflow `nodeTypes` + controlled-state mental model, Vue-natural — and it is the *same* model on Solid and Lit, which have no such library at all.
- **Framework-native node bodies on all six** — each `<NodeType>`'s `#body` is a **reactive multi-instance portal**: one handle mounts per graph node of that type, rendering a real framework fragment (any component, any reactivity), re-rendered in place as the node's data / selection changes.
- **Automatic typed-socket validation on all six** — port `type` lives on the `<Port>` schema, so the canvas auto-rejects type-mismatched connections (`:validate-types`, default on) with `canConnect` as the optional custom-rule override — a feature the standalone editors leave to consumer glue.
- **The engine owns interaction, so behavior is identical by construction** — pan/zoom transform, node drag, edge drawing, and connection-handle hit-testing all live in Rete's `AreaPlugin` + `ConnectionPlugin`. Rozie never re-implements pointer math per target, so there is no cross-framework drift in *how the editor feels*.
- **A uniform 12-verb imperative handle** (`getEditor` / `getArea` / `addNode` / `removeNode` / `addConnection` / `removeConnection` / `clear` / `zoomToFit` / `zoomTo` / `getNodes` / `getConnections` / `getTransform`) grabbed with each framework's native ref — versus "however this library happens to expose its instance" (a hook, a service, a ref).
- **`getEditor()` / `getArea()` are always one hop from the raw engine**, so the full Rete API (custom plugins, `rete-engine` dataflow, `rete-auto-arrange-plugin`, …) is reachable on any target when the curated surface doesn't cover something.

## The controlled-graph + `<NodeType>` / `<Port>` model {#controlled-graph}

`FlowCanvas` follows the **controlled-graph** mental model (xyflow's `nodeTypes` +
controlled `nodes`/`edges`, made Vue-natural with `r-model`): the consumer binds **one
`graph` object** and declares node **TYPE templates** — nothing more. The canvas is the
middleware: it renders each node by its `type` (render-by-type), owns drag / zoom / connect
/ validation, and **writes layout (`x`/`y` on drag) and connections (on connect /
disconnect) back** into the bound object, so the developer never hand-reconciles.

```html
<FlowCanvas r-model:graph="$data.graph" :validate-types="true" @connection-rejected="onReject">
  <NodeType type="source">
    <template #body="{ node }">{{ node.data.label }}</template>
    <Port output="num" type="number" />
    <Port output="str" type="string" />
  </NodeType>
  <NodeType type="merge">
    <template #body="{ node }">Merge</template>
    <Port input="num" type="number" multiple />
    <Port input="str" type="string" multiple />
  </NodeType>
</FlowCanvas>
```

with `$data.graph = { nodes: [{ id, type, x, y, data }], connections: [...] }` — the
**single source of truth**.

- **`<NodeType type>` declares a node TYPE once** (a `#body` template scoped `{ node, selected, emit }` + a nested `<Port>` schema). Every graph node whose `type` matches renders this template; a `<NodeType>` has **no** `id`/`x`/`y` — instance identity + position live in the bound `graph`, not on the tag. This cleanly separates "what a `source` looks like" from "this source exists at x,y" — the disjoint the old instance-children model (`<FlowNode id>`) conflated.
- **`<Port output=|input= type= [multiple]>` declares one typed directional port** on its `<NodeType>`. Direction is the attribute name (`output` / `input`); `type` drives automatic validation. _(The attrs are `input`/`output`, not `in`/`out` — `in` is a JS reserved word that the Svelte `$props()` destructure rejects.)_
- **Edges live ONLY in `graph.connections`.** There is no flat `<Connection>` child — drawing or removing an edge writes a fresh `connections` array back through the `graph` model.

**Why the node body is a named `#body` slot, not bare children.** A node body has to *teleport* into the node element the Rete engine creates — it doesn't render in the normal component tree. Rozie mounts that body through a portal (`$portals.body`), which gives it a fresh framework render-root inside the engine-owned host. But a portal render-root has no tree ancestor, so context-consuming children placed inside it would not resolve their `$inject` on five of six targets (context is tree-scoped on React/Vue/Svelte/Solid/Lit). Separating the teleported body (`<template #body>`) from the context-consuming `<Port>` children (which stay in the normal child position) is therefore the robust cross-framework shape: the body teleports, the ports keep their tree scope and inject correctly. Verified behaviorally across all six targets (including the Angular real-build).

This was built by dogfooding Rozie's own cross-component context primitive (`$provide` / `$inject`): `<FlowCanvas>` provides a per-TYPE registry, `<NodeType>` provides a nested per-type sub-context, and `<Port>` injects it.

## What Rozie defers {#what-rozie-defers}

This page concedes where the standalone libraries are genuinely ahead — that's what keeps the comparison credible, and it doubles as Rozie's roadmap.

- **MiniMap / Background variants / NodeToolbar / NodeResizer.** React Flow ships these as first-class components. `FlowCanvas` v1 covers the canvas + nodes + sockets + connections + a dotted background; the second-tier chrome is on the roadmap (config-prop first, the MapLibre stance).
- **Big-framework depth on the home framework.** React Flow (Zustand store, deep node/edge-type catalogs, helper hooks, layouting integrations) is a mature, multi-year library; on React it exposes more surface than Rozie's curated set. Rozie's value is **not** "more than React Flow on React" — it's the **same idiomatic editor on all six frameworks from one source**, with the unserved **Solid and Lit** finally covered.
- **`@rozie-ui/rete` is `0.1.0`.** The surface (13 props / 8 events / 12-verb handle / `<NodeType>` render-by-type body portal + typed `<Port>` schema) is stable and gate-verified (behavioral parity across all six targets), but it is younger than the incumbents.

## Try it

The [`@rozie-ui/rete` showcase + API reference](/components/rete) documents the `@rozie-ui/rete-*` packages — one pre-compiled, per-framework install (`npm i @rozie-ui/rete-react rete rete-area-plugin rete-connection-plugin rete-render-utils`, etc.). Rete ships no stylesheet, so there is no engine CSS to import — all node / socket / connection chrome is styled by the component.
