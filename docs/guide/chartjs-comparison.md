# Chart.js libraries comparison

[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is the most-installed canvas charting
library on the web, and — unlike FullCalendar — it ships **no official framework
connectors**. Every framework binding is a separate community project, and the
quality varies wildly: React and Vue are served by large, healthy wrappers;
Angular and Svelte have solid maintained ones; **Solid's only option has been
frozen since mid-2024; and Lit has no modern Chart.js wrapper at all.**

Rozie's [`@rozie-ui/chartjs`](/guide/chartjs) compiles one `.rozie` file to
idiomatic React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Solid, and Lit consumers — six framework
targets from a single source, each a pre-compiled `@rozie-ui/chartjs-*` package
with no Rozie toolchain required. The same generic `Chart` (the `type` prop
drives the whole controller set), the same three structured events, the same
eight-verb imperative handle, the same external-HTML **tooltip portal slot**, and
the same `:plugins` passthrough — on all six.

Every wrapper on this page — including Rozie's — drives the **same `chart.js`
engine, current major v4 (`4.5.x`)**. The engine is shared and well-maintained, so
this comparison is purely about the **per-framework binding layer**: which
frameworks have a binding at all, how current it is, and how consistent the
events / imperative-handle / custom-tooltip story is across them.

## Why Rozie's row reads the way it does

- **Cross-framework reach from one source — the headline.** Chart.js has no
  official connectors, so the matrix is a patchwork: React (≈3.8M/wk) and Vue
  (≈0.85M/wk) are healthy; Angular (ng2-charts, ≈0.45M/wk) and Svelte
  (svelte-chartjs, Svelte-5-ready) are solid and current; **Solid's only wrapper
  has been frozen since 2024-07 with no documented instance or event API; and Lit
  has no modern Chart.js wrapper at all** (the only named package targets Chart.js
  2.x / lit-element 1.x and was last touched in 2021). A team standardizing on
  Chart.js across all six frameworks gets two big wrappers, two solid ones, one
  stagnant package, and one hole. Rozie compiles a single `.rozie` definition to
  all six idiomatic targets. **That is the wedge: not "more popular than
  react-chartjs-2," but "the same component everywhere — including the two
  frameworks the ecosystem leaves stagnant or empty."**

- **A uniform, structured event surface across all six.** This is the single
  biggest *capability* difference. Chart.js click/hover handling fragments badly
  per framework: react-chartjs-2 and svelte-chartjs give you `options.onClick`
  plus exported `getElementAtEvent` *helper functions* (no framework events);
  vue-chartjs emits **no** Vue events at all; ng2-charts is the only one with
  native framework events (`chartClick` / `chartHover`); Solid and Lit have none.
  Rozie surfaces **three** events — [`@click` / `@hover` /
  `@datasetClick`](/guide/chartjs#events) — with structured payloads
  (`{ event, elements, chart }`, the hit elements already resolved via
  `getElementsAtEventForMode`) **identically on all six targets**, and each is
  *composed* over any consumer-supplied `options.onClick`/`onHover` rather than
  clobbering it. One event shape to learn once, on any framework.

- **The external-HTML tooltip as a first-class portal slot, everywhere.** No
  competitor offers a framework-native tooltip slot or render-prop — on every
  one of them a custom HTML tooltip means hand-writing
  `options.plugins.tooltip.external`, a DOM-building callback that lives outside
  the framework's rendering model. Rozie surfaces it as
  [one `tooltip` portal slot](/guide/chartjs#slots) that emits the framework's
  idiomatic consumer surface — React/Solid render-prop, Vue scoped-slot, Svelte
  snippet, Angular `ng-template` content-child, Lit slot bridge — fed the live
  tooltip model (`{ title, body, dataPoints, opacity }`). The slot is guarded:
  omit it and you get Chart.js's default canvas tooltip on every target. Because
  canvas owns its own paint, the external tooltip is the one place a
  framework-native fragment can render over the chart — so Rozie implements that
  one well, on all six.

- **A uniform imperative handle across all six.** Every competitor exposes the
  Chart.js instance its own way — a React `ref` to the instance, vue-chartjs's
  `ref.chart`, ng2-charts's `ViewChild(BaseChartDirective).chart`, svelte-chartjs's
  `bind:chart`, and nothing documented on Solid/Lit. Rozie's
  [`$expose` handle](/guide/chartjs#imperative-handle) is the *same* eight verbs —
  `getChart` / `updateChart` / `resizeChart` / `resetChart` / `renderChart` /
  `stopChart` / `clearChart` / **`toBase64Image`** (PNG export) — on every target,
  grabbed with each framework's native ref mechanism. `getChart()` returns the raw
  instance, so the full Chart.js API is always one hop away.

- **Angular emitted in the signals idiom.** ng2-charts — the dominant Angular
  wrapper — is a `canvas[baseChart]` **directive** built on `@Input()` +
  `OnChanges`, not Angular's signals model. Rozie's `@rozie-ui/chartjs-angular`
  is a standalone **component** whose props are signal `input()`s and whose
  reactivity runs through `effect()` — the Angular-19+ idiom — with the same
  `(click)`/`(hover)` outputs and `viewChild`-grabbable handle.

- **`:plugins` consumer-extensibility, applied uniformly.** Chart.js plugins
  (datalabels, annotation, zoom, a custom crosshair) are passed per-instance
  through [`:plugins`](/guide/chartjs#extending-with-plugins) — the Chart.js
  analog of an options bag — identically on all six targets, with no per-plugin
  wrapper code and zero bundle cost for plugins you don't engage. (This matches
  the per-instance `plugins` prop the React/Vue/Svelte wrappers also offer; the
  parity point is that Rozie does it *the same way everywhere*.)

## Caveats — where the existing wrappers genuinely win

This page concedes where the standalone wrappers are ahead — that's what keeps the
comparison credible, and it doubles as Rozie's own roadmap.

- **React 19 and Svelte 5 are already covered upstream.** Unlike the FullCalendar
  comparison, version currency is *not* a Rozie wedge here:
  `react-chartjs-2@5.3.1` already lists `react@^19` in its peer range, and
  `svelte-chartjs@4.0.1` already targets Svelte 5. Rozie installs cleanly against
  React 19 and Svelte 5 too — but it is matching the ecosystem on currency, not
  leading it. Rozie's advantage on React/Vue/Angular/Svelte is the *uniform
  cross-framework surface* and one source, not "more current."

- **Per-type components (`<Line>`, `<Bar>`, …) — react/vue/svelte/solid ship them;
  Rozie does not (yet).** react-chartjs-2, vue-chartjs, svelte-chartjs, and
  solid-chartjs all export eight typed convenience components, so a consumer writes
  `<Bar data={…} />` rather than `<Chart type="bar" data={…} />`. Rozie v1 ships
  only the generic `Chart` (the `type` prop covers the whole controller set). This
  is a real ergonomic gap and a tracked follow-up — see the
  [Chart.js showcase](/guide/chartjs) and the project's gap-closure plan.

- **Selective (tree-shakable) controller registration — the wrappers support it;
  Rozie v1 does not.** Chart.js v3+ is tree-shakable: react-chartjs-2's typed
  components register only their own controller, and vue/svelte/ng2 let the
  consumer `register(...)` (or `provideCharts(...)`) exactly the controllers,
  elements, scales, and plugins they use — keeping the bundle minimal. Rozie's
  generic `Chart` calls `Chart.register(...registerables)` unconditionally (the
  "kitchen sink") so the `type` prop can switch to any kind at runtime, which
  means a consumer who only renders line charts still ships every controller.
  Trading bundle size for runtime genericity is a deliberate v1 choice, and the
  fix is coupled to per-type components (each could register only its controller)
  — both are on the gap-closure plan.

- **`datasetIdKey` dataset diffing — react/vue have it; Rozie matches by index.**
  react-chartjs-2 and vue-chartjs expose a `datasetIdKey` prop so datasets are
  diffed by a stable key across updates (guarding the "first dataset copied over
  the others" hazard). Rozie reconciles datasets by array index, which is correct
  for the common append/replace cases but does not yet offer a keyed-diff opt-in.
  Tracked.

- **`fallbackContent` a11y — react/vue/solid render fallback inside the canvas.**
  Those wrappers let you render arbitrary fallback content inside the `<canvas>`
  for assistive tech. Rozie surfaces an `ariaLabel` prop today but not a
  fallback-content slot; a non-portal a11y fallback slot is a small tracked
  addition.

- **Single-framework ergonomics are not the contest.** The matrix scores
  out-of-the-box, cross-framework capability. For a single-React or single-Vue
  app, `react-chartjs-2` / `vue-chartjs` are large, excellent, battle-tested
  libraries and the obvious pick. Rozie's value is reaching all six frameworks —
  including the Solid wrapper that's frozen and the Lit one that doesn't exist —
  from one source, with one events/handle/tooltip surface to learn.

## Try it

The [`@rozie-ui/chartjs` showcase + API reference](/guide/chartjs) documents the
`@rozie-ui/chartjs-*` packages — one pre-compiled, per-framework install
(`npm i @rozie-ui/chartjs-react chart.js`, etc.). The
[`ChartScreenshotDemo` source](https://github.com/One-Learning-Community/rozie.js/blob/main/examples/demos/ChartScreenshotDemo.rozie)
renders line, bar, and doughnut from the one generic `Chart`, and the
[`ChartBehaviorDemo` source](https://github.com/One-Learning-Community/rozie.js/blob/main/examples/demos/ChartBehaviorDemo.rozie)
drives runtime type-switching, the `@click` event, the `:plugins` passthrough, and
the `tooltip` portal slot.
