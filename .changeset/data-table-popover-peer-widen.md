All six `@rozie-ui/data-table-<target>` leaves widen their `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` peer dependency from `^0.1.0` to `^0.1.0 || ^0.2.0`.

**Why both, not just the new one.** Combobox moves its own popover peer to `^0.2.0` in this same wave. A caret range on a 0.x version pins the minor, so leaving data-table's range at `^0.1.0` would give any consumer installing both the combobox family and the data-table family two mutually exclusive ranges for the same `@rozie-ui/popover-<target>` package — an unsatisfiable peer pair. Forcing data-table forward to `^0.2.0` alone would avoid that conflict but strand existing data-table consumers on a popover upgrade they have no reason to take, since data-table does not use any of popover's five new props. Admitting both ranges is the option that resolves the conflict without an unnecessary forced upgrade.

**Why it is safe to admit both.** Data-table composes a `<Popover>` at exactly two sites in source (`DataTable.rozie`), and both are byte-identical, binding only four props: `trigger="click"`, `placement="bottom-end"`, `strategy="fixed"`, `:offset="4"`. All four are present, unchanged, in both `0.1.x` and `0.2.0` — data-table binds none of popover's five new props (`bare`, `disablePositioning`, `keepMounted`, `matchWidth`, `disableDismiss`). The one behavioral change in this wave that touches existing consumers — `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded` gating on `hasGestureTrigger()` — only affects `trigger="manual"` popovers; data-table's `trigger="click"` stays on the gesture-trigger branch and sees no ARIA change in either version.

**Scope of the change.** There is no runtime, API, or DOM change in `@rozie-ui/data-table-<target>` itself. The entire leaf diff is the one peer dependency range line per target, six lines total. This changeset is deliberately separate from the popover-promotion changeset covering combobox and popover: it is its own story about data-table's peer contract, not a restatement of theirs.
