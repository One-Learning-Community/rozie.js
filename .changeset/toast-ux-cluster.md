Toast UX cluster — closes the four previously-deferred `@rozie-ui/toast` UX items in one wave:

- **Precise remaining-time hover pause.** Hovering the stack now stores each timer's exact remainder instead of a full restart — a 1000ms toast hovered ~600ms in and released dismisses ~400ms later, not after a fresh 1000ms.
- **The family's first event, `@dismissed { toast, reason }`.** Every dismissal (timer expiry, the close button, the `dismiss()` verb, or a swipe) routes through one funnel and fires `dismissed` exactly once, before a new CSS enter/exit animation lifecycle runs; `clear()` stays bulk and fires nothing.
- **`patch(id, changes)` and `promise(p, { loading, success, error })`.** `patch` updates an existing toast in place (message/type/duration, with duration-key timer restart semantics). `promise` shows a `{ type: 'loading' }` spinner toast synchronously and flips it to success/error at settle — the timer starts at settle, and a toast dismissed while pending is never resurrected.
- **Pointer swipe-to-dismiss**, on by default (`disableSwipe` opts out): direction auto-derived from `position`, a 45%-width/velocity threshold, rubber-band on the wrong direction, and spring-back below threshold.
- **An opt-in `stacked` collapsed stack**: a sonner-style depth-driven grid overlay (newest on top, depth 3+ hidden) that expands to the normal flex column on hover or keyboard focus.
- 6 new theming tokens (`--rozie-toast-enter-duration`, `--rozie-toast-exit-duration`, `--rozie-toast-stack-offset`, `--rozie-toast-stack-scale-step`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-size`, `--rozie-toast-spinner-color`) with preset mappings across the shadcn/Material/Bootstrap theme bridges.

The public surface grows from 5 props / 0 events / 3-verb handle to 7 props / 1 event / 5-verb handle; the `toast` scoped slot and all five existing props are unchanged. No breaking changes.
